So I wrote a simple R script. Here it is:
bytes &amp;lt;- file.size(&amp;quot;2017-05-15-an-r-script-for-calculating-reading-time-of-an-article.Rmd&amp;quot;) words &amp;lt;- bytes/10 minutes &amp;lt;- words/200 The script is very simple, such that even I could program it.</description>

      <description>The accompanying R Notebook is a simple example that combines R code chunks, Python code chunks, and BibTeX literature citations in one R Markdown document.
