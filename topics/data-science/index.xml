Yes, it doth work. The blogdown package can nicely deal with R Markdown containing embedded R code for production of statistical analyses and graphics.
But.
It cannot deal with R Notebooks, which contain a special flavor of R Markdown allowing for interactive display of R code alongside the results they produce. R Notebooks, when rendered into HTML, produce a special file named *.nb.html to signify that they are an HTML notebook.</description>

Following the directions for Google’s Custom Search Engine, with additional help from How I added search to my static blog, I have added a local search function to this website. It’s on the sidebar menu, with an adorable magnifying glass icon from Font Awesome Icons, and it basically works.
This search function will, in all likelihood, probably search only the specific content of richardlent.</description>

We now attempt to insert into our R Markdown file, which Hugo then renders into HTML, an mp4 video of dragonflies (insect order Odonata, in case you’re wondering) that were congregating in my front yard a few summers ago.
So I’m thinking, just insert it using a regular Markdown image tag, yes?
Like this:
![](/mp4/Dragonflies.mp4).
  And so, that worked.
To center this video on the page I am using the deprecated HTML &amp;lt;center&amp;gt; tag inside of my R Markdown.</description>

I was until very recently involved in an epic struggle to get the system described in Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages to work for me. (See also Building a Blog with Blogdown and GitHub.) I really want it to work, because it has produced the current website that you are now reading, and I’m sure you’ll agree that it is very, very beautiful, in a stark, post-apocalyptic, Mordor-esque sort of way.</description>
