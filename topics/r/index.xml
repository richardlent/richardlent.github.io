      <description>Reading time: 1 minute(s) @ 200 WPM.
We now attempt to insert into our R Markdown file, which Hugo then renders into HTML, an mp4 video of dragonflies (insect order Odonata, in case you’re wondering) that were congregating in my front yard a few summers ago.
So I’m thinking, just insert it using a regular Markdown image tag, yes?
Like this:
![](/mp4/Dragonflies.mp4).
  And so, that worked.
To center this video on the page I am using the deprecated HTML &amp;lt;center&amp;gt; tag inside of my R Markdown.</description>

      <title>Making Maps with R</title>

      <description>Making maps on a computer has traditionally required the use of desktop geographic information system (GIS) software such as ArcGIS or QGIS. An alternative is to use R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R has many features that allow it to read GIS data and produce both static and interactive maps. This document (which is an R Notebook) shows how to make maps with R and RStudio, using R base graphics and the maps and mapdata packages, in addition to the leaflet and tmap packages.</description>

      <description>The R Notebook Habitat structure and phenotypic variation in the invading butterfly Coenonympha tullia is a mockup of a scientific paper (although the field data are real) to illustrate the use of R Notebooks as a means of creating reproducible research. The objective is to produce publication-quality output, in HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word formats, with text, literature citations, a formatted bibliography, statistical analyses, tables, and graphics, all from one, plain-text R Notebook.</description>
