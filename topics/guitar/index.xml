      <description>The song, not the hockey team (which, however, was named after the song). Written in 1914 by W. C. Handy, Saint Louis Blues has a long history and has been performed by Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Bessie Smith, and many others. The version I play here was arranged and recorded by John Fahey and can be found on several of his albums (Blind Joe Death, Vol. 1, Takoma C-1002; The Legend of Blind Joe Death, Fantasy TAK 8901, 1996; The Best of John Fahey, 1959-1977, Takoma 7058, 1977.</description>

      <description>My take on Leo Kottke’s arrangement of the old banjo tune. If you listen carefully, somewhere around the third section I substituted about 20 seconds of original material. Recorded live at Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Steve Friedman of Melville Park Studio, July 8, 2002.
If you want to hear Kottke himself play it, here you go:
  But please, no comparisons with me.

      <description>This is a tune by John Fahey that was originally recorded as a duet with Woody Mann. The original recording can be found on two Fahey albums: Old Fashioned Love (Takoma C1043, 1975) and The Return Of The Repressed: Anthology (Rhino R2 71737, 1994). Here I have arranged the tune for solo guitar and have added a few more sections. Fahey’s liner notes on this piece, from Return of the Repressed, read: “A duet with Woody Mann.</description>
