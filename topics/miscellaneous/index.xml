      <description>There seems to be a bug in blogdown in which time stamps for posts are all 00:00.
Either that or there is something in some setting somewheres that I am missing.
If we use the blogdown “New Post” RStudio addin, the time stamp for the post is 00:00.
However, if we create a post using the blogdown new_post() function, the time stamp is correct.
This either needs to be fixed or I need to be re-educated.</description>

      <description>This site is written, built, and maintained in RStudio using the R blogdown package and the Hugo static website generator. See Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub.
An apparent quirk (or maybe it’s a feature) of this system is that hyperlinks are not displayed in the short summary displayed by default for each post. The summary consists simply of the first n lines of the posts’s text, where the variable n has a value that is unknown to me.</description>
