      <description>Reading time: 3 minute(s) @ 200 WPM.
I have worked for days trying to get this website up and running on GitHub Pages. I think I finally have gotten it to work.
This is that story.
I have studied the following sources of punditage:
 Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages Update: Deploying Hugo-generated websites on personal GitHub Pages How to make a GitHub pages blog with RStudio and Hugo Including image using blogdown Building a Blog with Blogdown and GitHub The Hugo documentation Create Blogs and Websites with R Markdown Hosting on GitHub Pages Build_Site and Serve_Site Output Issues Create a Free Personal Academic Website with Hugo  All of the articles and discussions were enlightening, and helped me arrive at what I believe to be the simplest way to deploy a Hugo-generated website on GitHub Pages, at least for me.</description>
