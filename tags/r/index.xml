To see how we just did that, read on.
Because psychological research tells us that including estimated reading times can increase reader engagement with digital content, I decided to include reading times for my riveting posts.
So I wrote a simple R script. Here it is, as an R code chunk:
```{r echo=FALSE} bytes  The script is very simple, such that even I could program it.</description>

Yes, it doth work. The blogdown package can nicely deal with R Markdown containing embedded R code for production of statistical analyses and graphics.
But.
It cannot deal with R Notebooks, which contain a special flavor of R Markdown allowing for interactive display of R code alongside the results they produce. R Notebooks, when rendered into HTML, produce a special file named *.nb.html to signify that they are an HTML notebook.</description>
