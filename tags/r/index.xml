      <description>This is a DRAFT! Introduction    Reading time: 2 minute(s) @ 200 WPM.
This is a DRAFT! So, this post should not be here. Itâ€™s marked as a draft in RStudio, and Hugo should not build it.
But it seems that including it is the only way to get all the other files of this website to be in sync, so here it is. Readers may follow it as it develops.</description>

      <description>Reading time: 2 minute(s) @ 200 WPM.
To see how we just did that, read on.
Because psychological research tells us that including estimated reading times can increase reader engagement with digital content, I decided to include reading times for my riveting posts.
So I wrote a simple R script. Here it is:
bytes &amp;lt;- file.size(&amp;quot;2017-05-15-an-r-script-for-calculating-reading-time-of-an-article.Rmd&amp;quot;) words &amp;lt;- bytes/10 minutes &amp;lt;- words/200 The script is very simple, such that even I could program it.</description>
