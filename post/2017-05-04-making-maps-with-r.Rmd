Making maps on a computer has traditionally required the use of desktop geographic information system (GIS) software such as [ArcGIS](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/) or [QGIS.](http://qgis.org/) An alternative is to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R has many features that allow it to read GIS data and produce both static and interactive maps. This document (which is an [R Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)) shows how to make maps with R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), using R base graphics and the [maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/index.html) and [mapdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapdata/index.html) packages, in addition to the [leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap) packages. We will also map U.S. Census data with help from the [tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) and [acs](https://github.com/cran/acs) packages.
