There seems to be a bug in [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) in which time stamps for posts are all `00:00`.

Either that or there is something in some setting somewheres that I am missing.

If we use the `blogdown` "New Post" RStudio addin, the time stamp for the post is 00:00.

However, if we create a post using the `blogdown` `new_post()` function, the time stamp is correct.

This either needs to be fixed or I need to be re-educated.
