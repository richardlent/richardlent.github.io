My take on [Leo Kottke's](http://leokottke.com) arrangement of the old banjo tune.  If you listen carefully, somewhere around the third section I substituted about 20 seconds of original material. Recorded live at <a href="http://www.passim.org">Club Passim</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Steve Friedman of [Melville Park Studio](http://melvillepark.com), July 8, 2002.

If you want to hear Kottke himself play it, here you go:

But please, no comparisons with me.
