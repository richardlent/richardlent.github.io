This is a tune by [John Fahey](http://www.johnfahey.com/) that was originally recorded as a duet with [Woody Mann](http://www.woodymann.com/). The original recording can be found on two Fahey albums: [Old Fashioned Love](http://johnfahey.com/pages/ofl.html) (Takoma C1043, 1975) and [The Return Of The Repressed: Anthology](http://johnfahey.com/pages/ror.html) (Rhino R2 71737, 1994). Here I have arranged the tune for solo guitar and have added a few more sections. Fahey's liner notes on this piece, from *Return of the Repressed*, read: "A duet with Woody Mann. I was in open C; don't know what Woody was in. I lived in a Hindu monastery in India for a while, and that was the first song we'd sing in the morning before meditation, 4 a.m. Traditional Hindu."
