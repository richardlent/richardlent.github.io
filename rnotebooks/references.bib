  abstract = {We investigated factors affecting nest success of songbirds in riparian forest and buffers in northeastern Missouri. We used an information-theoretic approach to determine support for hypotheses concerning effects of nest-site, habitat-patch, edge, and temporal factors on nest success of songbirds in three narrow (55\textendash{}95 m) and three wide (400\textendash{}530 m) riparian forests with adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips and in three narrow and three wide riparian forests without adjacent grassland-shrub buffer strips. We predicted that temporal effects would have the most support and that habitat-patch and edge effects would have little support, because nest predation would be great across all sites in the highly fragmented, predominantly agricultural landscape. Interval nest success was 0.404, 0.227, 0.070, and 0.186, respectively, for Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and forest interior species pooled (Acadian Flycatcher [Empidonax virescens], Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapillus], and Kentucky Warbler [Oporornis formosus]). The effect of nest stage on nest success had the most support; daily nest success for Gray Catbird and Indigo Bunting were lowest in the laying stage. We found strong support for greater nest success of Gray Catbird in riparian forests with adjacent buffer strips than in riparian forests without adjacent buffer strips. Patch width also occurred in the most-supported model for Gray Catbird, but with very limited support. The null model received the most support for Northern Cardinal. Riparian forests provided breeding habitat for area-sensitive forest species and grassland-shrub nesting species. Buffer strips provided additional breeding habitat for grassland-shrub nesting species. Interval nest success for Indigo Bunting and area-sensitive forest species pooled, however, fell well below the level that is likely necessary to balance juvenile and adult mortality, which suggests that when riparian forests are located within agricultural landscapes, the potential even for wide riparian forests with adjacent buffer strips to provide high-quality breeding habitat is severely diminished for some species.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Historically, studies of habitat selection have focused on quantifying how current patterns of habitat occupancy influence condition and survival within a season. This approach, however, is overly simplistic, especially for migratory birds that spend different periods of the year in geographically distinct places. Habitat occupancy and the resulting condition of individual birds is likely to be affected by events in the previous season, and the consequences of habitat occupancy will influence individuals and populations in subsequent seasons. Thus, for migratory birds, variation in habitat quality (and quantity) needs to be understood in the context of how events interact throughout periods of the annual cycle. Seasonal interactions can occur at the individual level or population level. Individual-level interactions occur when events in one season produce nonlethal, residual effects that carry over to influence individuals the following season. Population-level interactions occur when a change in population size in one season influences per capita rates the following season. We review various methods for estimating seasonal interactions and highlight a number of examples in the literature. Using a variety of techniques, including intrinsic and extrinsic markers, the vast majority of studies to date have measured seasonal interactions at the individual level. Obtaining estimates of density and changes in per capita rates across multiple seasons to determine population-level interactions has been more challenging. Both types of seasonal interactions can influence population dynamics, but predicting their effects requires detailed knowledge of how populations are geographically connected (i.e., migratory connectivity). We recommend that researchers studying habitat occupancy and habitat selection consider how events in previous seasons influence events within a season.},

  abstract = {Climate change and habitat fragmentation are considered key pressures on biodiversity. In this paper we explore the potential synergetic effects between these factors. We argue that processes at two levels of spatial scale interact: the metapopulation level and the species range level. Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion. Taking into account the effects of climate change on metapopulations, habitat distribution and land use changes, future biodiversity research and conservation strategies are facing the challenge to re-orient their focus and scope by integrating spatially and conceptually more dynamic aspects at the landscape level.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Significant climatic changes due to the greenhouse effect are predicted to occur in breeding and Wintering areas of neotropical migrant landbirds within 50 years. A simulation model was used to quantitatively evaluate the impact of predicted climatic changes on the annual productivity (number of fledgling $\cdot$ pair?1 season?1) of Blackthroated Blue Warbllers (Dendroica caerulescens). breeding in northern hardwoods forests. Results suggested that where mean summer rainfall increases by 20\%, greater egg and nestling mortality may reduce annual breeding productivity by as much as 26\%. Warmer temperatures however, will tend to enhance food abundance for insectivorous birds and lengthen the avian breeding season. These changes will act to increase breeding productivity, but they can only compensate for about a 10\% increase in precipitation. Precipitation, however, is predicted to decline over most of the range of Black-throated Blue Warblers. Where mean temperature is warmer and average summer precipitation is lower by as little as 10\%, breeding productivity of Black-throated Blue Warblers may be enhanced by up to 25\%. Because significant regional differences in climatic change are likely, and because migratory bird species will differ in their response to climatic change, the emphasis of avian research should be on intensive regional studies of the factors influencing avian reproduction and survival.

We studied hatch-year (HY) and after-hatch-year (AHY) Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) to determine if differences in foraging efficiency and molt affected fat deposition prior to autumn migration. Hatch-year catbirds were less efficient foragers than AHY catbirds; however, efficiency improved with age to the extent that many HY catbirds are probably as efficient as AHY birds by the time they commence migration. We discovered age-dependent patterns of fat deposition, which probably resulted from differences in foraging efficiency and molt timing. Hatch-year catbirds began to deposit fat sooner than AHY catbirds but did so more slowly throughout the postbreeding and premigratory phases of the annual cycle. Adult catbirds did not become hyperphagic until they neared the completion of their molt, then deposited fat rapidly.},

Forty-five and 15 nests were checked at the Astronomy and Toftrees study areas, respectively. The number of overstory and understory trees, percent leaf litter, and distance to spray nozzles varied significantly (P $<$ 0.05) between nest sites and random sites. Of the 60 nests, 70\% fledged at least one young. The probabilities of eggs surviving from incubation to fledging were similar between study areas (0.61 and 0.57 at Astronomy and Toftrees, respectively).

We examined the repeatability of hematocrits in a population of Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) in Pennsylvania at several time scales and also examined the repeatability of body mass, another measure commonly used as an indicator of condition. Both hematocrit (r= 0.64) and mass (r= 0.65) were repeatable (P $<$ 0.01) for first captures between years and between first and second captures within a year (r= 0.41 and r= 0.50, respectively; P $<$ 0.01), but not repeatable (P $>$ 0.05) between captures in different months within a year (r= 0.11 for both). Repeatability of both measures differed by sex and age. Females exhibited repeatability of hematocrit and body mass only between years, while male hematocrits were repeatable between years and between first and second captures within a season. Male mass was repeatable for all time periods. Hematocrits of younger birds were repeatable between captures within a season and their body mass was repeatable between months and weeks while hematocrits of older birds were not repeatable and their body mass was repeatable only between captures in a season. Our results indicate that hematocrits and body mass had similar repeatability coefficients overall, but that hematocrits of Gray Catbirds were a consistent trait of individuals only across years. Because repeatability between captures and months depended on sex and age, we conclude that the hematocrit is a useful measure of individual performance only in limited circumstances.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Understanding the effect of habitat alteration on avian behavior is important for understanding a species' ecology and ensuring its conservation. Therefore, we examined the relationship between Spotted Owl habitat selection and variation in habitat in the Sierra Nevada. We estimated habitat selection by modeling the probability of territory colonization ($\gamma$), territory extinction ($\epsilon$), and breeding dispersal in relation to the amount of mature conifer forest within and among territories. Alteration of $\geq$20 ha of mature conifer forest (coniferous forest with $>$70\% canopy cover dominated by medium [30.4\textendash{}60.9 cm dbh] and large [$>$60.9 cm dbh] trees) within individual territories (n = 66) was negatively related to territory colonization and positively related to breeding dispersal probability. Although territory extinction was negatively related to the amount of mature conifer forest, it was not clear whether this relationship was due to variation of mature conifer forest within or among territories. Although modeling results for territory colonization and extinction generally supported the hypothesis that individuals are ``ideal'' when selecting a habitat in the sense that they settle in the highest-quality site available, we did not find a clear benefit in terms of habitat quality for Spotted Owls that exhibited breeding dispersal.},

Prospecting non-breeding individuals have been shown to collect information on breeding sites a year ahead of breeding, but whether experienced breeders prospect future breeding sites is less well-known. Using data on post-breeding movements and between-year site shifts from a long-term population study of the migratory northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe L.), we investigated (1) whether breeding territory selection of experienced breeders was a two-step process, made partly in the post-breeding period and partly at the time of territory establishment in the subsequent year; (2) predictions of which factors and cues correlate to site shifts at these two selection periods; and (3) consequences of territory shifts. 2. Many wheatears stayed close to their breeding site during the post-breeding period, but about 20\% shifted to new potential breeding sites. Males that shifted to a new post-breeding location were also more likely to shift territory between years. 3. Factors linked to site shifts differed in the two investigated episodes of site selection. Post-breeding site shifts were linked to an environmental predictor of individual fitness, which is also related to foraging conditions (i.e. wheatears moved from tall to short field layers). Post-breeding site shifts, however, were not more frequent among young and failed breeders which may benefit most from prospecting for alternative breeding sites. Instead, in line with predictions of improving breeding conditions between-year site shifts were more frequent among young (only males) and failed breeders, whereas the link to territory field layer height disappeared. 4. Young males occupied more attractive sites and were more likely to breed successfully in year t + 1, but this improvement could also be expected from random choice. 5. Our results suggest that even though site shifts are determined partly during the post-breeding period, post-breeding movements of experienced breeders may be costly, especially when the breeding site is also a good foraging and moulting site in the post-breeding season. Under such circumstances an individual's choice of breeding site may often be determined at arrival in the subsequent year.},

Ninety-five nests of 14 species, mainly rufous-sided towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) (28.4\%) and gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) (24.2\%), were located. Observed versus expected numbers of total nests (all species combined) and those of towhees and catbirds differed (P $<$ 0.05) among stands of 3 age classes; the majority of total (91.6\%), towhee (92.3\%), and catbird (100\%) nests was found in stands .ltoreq. 10 years old. Observed versus expected numbers of both total and towhee nests did not differ (P $>$ 0.05) in relation to distance from an edge. However, observed numbers of catbird nests varied (P $<$ 0.05) from what I expected with respect to distance from an edge; most (95.7\%) were located .gtoreq. 10 m from an edge. Young were fledged at 52.6\% of the total nests. Nesting success was independent (P $>$ 0.05) of stand age and distance from and edge but was inversely related (P $<$ 0.05) to height of nests. Higher nests ($>$0.5 m above ground level) were more susceptible than lower nests (.ltoreq. 0.5 m) to predators.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Nest predation may influence habitat selection by birds at multiple spatial scales. We blended population and community ecology to investigate this possibility for 15 species of forest songbirds and their diurnal nest predators (corvids and sciurids) in 28 1 km2 sites near Seattle, Washington, from 1998 to 2004. We determined whether songbirds were positively or negatively associated with nest predators at three spatial scales, and whether their co-occurrence affected reproductive success. At the largest `neighborhood' scale (1 km2 areas that included suburban and exurban development and second-growth forest remnants), nest predators and their prey were positively or negatively correlated according to general species-specific habitat associations. At the intermediate `forest patch' scale (among remnant forested areas 0.5 to 70 ha), associations between predators and prey were generally weak. At the smallest `within patch' scale (multiple 50 m radius survey plots within each forest patch), some songbird species avoided areas with greater predator use, particularly by Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri). Failed nests and territories tended to be in locations of higher predator occurrence (especially of corvids) than successful ones, but at the largest 1 km2 neighborhood scale relative abundance of nest predators was not correlated with the fate of nesting attempts or annual reproductive success. Reproductive success was generally high, with 52\% of all nests and 49\% of all territories fledging at least one young (for all species and years combined). Nest predation influenced some species' use of resources, but was not a strong influence on overall reproductive success or community structure.},

  abstract = {Many recent studies have shown that birds are advancing their laying date in response to long-term increases in spring temperatures. These studies have been conducted primarily in Europe and at local scales. If climate change is a large-scale phenomenon, then we should see responses at larger scales and in other regions. We examined the effects of long-term temperature change on the laying dates and clutch sizes of six ecologically diverse species of North American birds using 50 years of nest record data. As predicted, laying dates for most (four of six) species were earlier when spring temperatures were warmer. Over the long-term, laying dates advanced over time for two species (red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus and eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis). Laying date of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) also advanced with increasing temperature when the analysis was restricted to eastern populations. Neither laying date nor clutch sizes changed significantly over time in the remaining species (American coot, Fulica americana, killdeer, Charadrius vociferous, and American robin, Turdus migratorius), an unsurprising result given the lack of increase in temperatures over time at nest locations of these species. This study indicates that the relationship between climate change and breeding in birds is variable within and among species. In large-scale analyses of North American birds, four of seven species have shown advances in laying dates with increasing temperature (including song sparrows in the east). These variable responses within and among species highlight the need for more detailed studies across large spatial scales.},

The patterns of correlation among habitat variables can introduce correlations among demographic rates, even if any single habitat variable affects only a single demographic rate and is independent of others. I present a simple model in which habitat is composed of two continuous habitat variables, one of which affects fecundity but not survival, and the other of which affects survival but not fecundity, such that correlations between survival and fecundity are due exclusively to correlations between the habitat variables. When individuals are able to select habitat with complete information about habitat quality, habitat selection always leads to higher growth rates at small population sizes. With complete information about habitat quality, patterns of distribution and population growth rates are strongly affected by the correlation between habitat variables. In contrast, when individuals have information about only fecundity or survival but not both, distributions become insensitive to correlations among habitat variables, which can lead to an ecological trap. This simple model demonstrates why explicitly distinguishing between habitat choices and the consequences of choices will be necessary if the complex interplay between habitat structure, habitat choice, and habitat quality is to be fully understood.},

There is already compelling evidence that birds have been affected by recent climate changes. This review suggests that although there is a substantial body of evidence for changes in the phenology of birds, particularly of the timing of migration and of nesting, the consequences of these responses for a species' population dynamics is still an area requiring in-depth research. The potential for phenological miscuing (responding inappropriately to climate change, including a lack of response) and for phenological disjunction (in which a bird species becomes out of synchrony with its environment) are beginning to be demonstrated, and are also important areas for further research. The study of climatically induced distributional change is currently at a predictive modelling stage, and will need to develop methods for testing these predictions. Overall, there is a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could potentially inhibit adaptation to climate change and these are a high priority for research.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Understanding habitat quality for birds is crucial for ecologists and managers, but few papers have explored the advantages and disadvantages of different ways to measure it. In this review I clarify terminology and distinguish habitat quality from related terms, differentiate habitat quality at the levels of individual birds and populations, and describe different field methods for measuring habitat quality. As much as feasible, biologists concerned with habitat quality should emphasize demographic variables while recognizing that reproduction, survival, and abundance may not all be positively correlated. The distribution of birds can also reveal habitat quality (e.g., through patterns of habitat selection), but researchers should first investigate how closely their subjects follow ideal distributions because numerous ecological factors can lead birds to select poor and avoid rich habitats. Measures of body condition can provide convenient measures of habitat quality, but to be useful they must be a consequence, rather than a cause, of habitat selection. Habitat ecologists should use caution before relying on shortcuts from more labor-intensive demographic work. To increase the reliability of our habitat quality measurements, we should work to develop new methods to assess critical assumptions of nondemographic indicators, such as whether birds follow ideal distributions under natural conditions and whether spatial variation in body condition manifests in differential fitness.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. The concept that animals benefit from gaining familiarity with physical spaces is widespread among ecologists and constitutes a theoretical pillar in studies of territory defence, philopatry and habitat selection. Yet proximate causes and fitness benefits of site familiarity are poorly known. 2. We used data from marked common loons Gavia immer breeding on 98 territories over 14 years to investigate the win-stay, lose-switch rule for nestsite placement (if eggs hatch, reuse nestsite; if predator takes eggs, move nestsite). Males controlled nest placement in this species: pairs used the rule if both members remained the same from the previous nesting attempt or if only the male remained the same but not if only the female remained the same. 3. By means of the nesting rule, male common loons benefited from site familiarity, increasing nesting success by 41\% between their first and third years on a territory. In contrast, females exhibited no increase in nesting success with increased territorial tenure. 4. Owing to site familiarity, a male loon competing for a breeding territory faces a considerable familiarity deficit compared with the male breeder already established there. The familiarity deficit probably explains why resident animals often fight hard to retain familiar territories, when challenged, and why animals of many species tend to remain on familiar territories rather than moving when territories of higher intrinsic quality become available nearby.},

  abstract = {Manipulative experimentation that features random assignment of treatments, replication, and controls is an effective way to determine causal relationships. Wildlife ecologists, however, often must take a more passive approach to investigating causality. Their observational studies lack one or more of the 3 cornerstones of experimentation: controls, randomization, and replication. Although an observational study can be analyzed similarly to an experiment, one is less certain that the presumed treatment actually caused the observed response. Because the investigator does not actively manipulate the system, the chance that something other than the treatment caused the observed results is increased. We reviewed observational studies and contrasted them with experiments and, to a lesser extent, sample surveys. We identified features that distinguish each method of learning and illustrate or discuss some complications that may arise when analyzing results of observational studies. Findings from observational studies are prone to bias. Investigators can reduce the chance of reaching erroneous conclusions by formulating a priori hypotheses that can be pursued multiple ways and by evaluating the sensitivity of study conclusions to biases of various magnitudes. In the end, however, professional judgment that considers all available evidence is necessary to render a decision regarding causality based on observational studies.},

In observational studies, treatments are assigned by Nature in a decidedly nonrandom manner; consequently, many of the crucial assumptions and safeguards of the classic experimental design either fail or are absent. Hence, inferences (causal or associative) are more difficult to justify. Typically, investigators can expect the primary factors of interest, which are usually called environmental exposures rather than treatments, to be involved in complex interactions with each other and with other factors, and these factors will be confounded with still other factors. We provide examples illustrating the application of ANCOVA models to adjust for confounding factors and complex interactions, thereby providing relatively clean estimates of association between exposure and response. We summarize information on available software and supporting literature for implementing ANCOVA models for the analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal observational field data. We conclude with a brief discussion of critical model fitting issues, including proper specification of the functional form of continuous covariates and problems associated with overfitted models and misspecified models that lack important covariates.},

boreal forest songbirds and temperate songbirds of non-forest habitats have become more
pointed over the last 100 years. In contrast, wings of most temperate forest and earlysuccessional
boreal forests species have become less pointed over the same period. In contrast
to wing shape, the bill length of most species did not change significantly through time. These
results are consistent with the ``habitat isolation hypothesis,'' i.e., songbirds evolved in
response to recent changes in the amount of available habitat and associated implications for
mobility. Rapid morphological evolution may mitigate, without necessarily preventing,
negative consequences of habitat loss caused by humans through direct exploitation or climate
change.},

Most grasslands are used as pasture or hayfields. Native grasses largely have been replaced by fescue (Festuca spp.) on most private lands (almost 7 million ha). Previously cropped fields set aside under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) varied from a mix of cool-season grasses and forbs, or mix of native warm-season grasses and forbs, to simple tall-grass monocultures. We used generalized linear mixed models and distance sampling to assess abundance of 8 species of breeding grassland birds on 6 grassland types commonly associated with farm practices in Missouri and located in landscapes managed for grassland-bird conservation. We selected Bird Conservation Areas (BCAs) for their high percentage of grasslands and grassland-bird species, and for \&lt;5\% forest cover. We used an information-theoretic approach to assess the relationship between bird abundance and 6 grassland types, 3 measures of vegetative structure, and 2 landscape variables (\% grassland and edge density within a 1-km radius). We found support for all 3 levels of model parameters, although there was less support for landscape than vegetation structure effects likely because we studied high-percentage-grassland landscapes (BCAs). Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) counts increased with greater percentage of grassland, vegetation height-density, litter depth, and shrub cover and lower edge density. Henslow's sparrow counts were greatest in hayed native prairie. Dickcissel (Spiza americana) counts increased with greater vegetation height-density and were greatest in planted CRP grasslands. Grasshopper sparrow (A. savannarum) counts increased with lower vegetation height, litter depth, and shrub cover. Based on distance modeling, breeding densities of Henslow's sparrow, dickcissel, and grasshopper sparrow in the 6 grassland types ranged 0.9\textendash{}2.6, 1.4\textendash{}3.2, and 0.1\textendash{}1.5\,birds/ha, respectively. We suggest different grassland types and structures (vegetation height, litter depth, shrub cover) are needed to support priority grassland-bird species in Missouri. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Natural ecological disturbance creates habitats that are used by diverse groups of birds. In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies involving the management of disturbance through some combination of flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale. Many aspects of the disturbance ecology of birds require further research. Important questions involve associations between the intensity and frequency of disturbance and the viability of bird populations, the scale of disturbance with respect to the spatial structure of populations, and the role of natural vs. anthropogenic disturbance. The effects of disturbance and ensuing successional processes on birds are potentially long-term, and comprehensive monitoring is essential.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Despite the fact that studies of urban ecology have become commonplace in the literature, ecologists still lack empirical evidence of the underlying mechanisms responsible for relationships between urbanization and animal community structure. In an effort to understand the processes that govern an apparent avoidance of urban landscapes by many Nearctic-Neotropical migratory birds, we examined population- and individual-level responses of the Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) to urbanization within the landscapes surrounding 35 riparian forest stands in Ohio, USA. 2. From May to August 2001-06 we surveyed birds, banded 175 territorial flycatchers to estimate both condition and survival, tracked nest initiation dates, monitored success of 387 nests and estimated annual reproductive productivity of 163 breeding pairs. 3. Neither apparent annual survival of males (phi = 0.53 +- 0.056 SE) nor females (phi = 0.23 +- 0.064 SE) was related to the amount of urban development within the landscape. Similarly, daily survival rates of nests, which ranged from 0.92 to 0.98 across sites, was not associated significantly with urbanization. In contrast, reproductive productivity was related negatively to the amount of urbanization surrounding riparian forests, perhaps due in part to the greater incidence of brood parasitism and fewer numbers of nesting attempts made by pairs in urban compared to rural forests. 4. Forests within urban landscapes experienced higher levels of turnover in site occupancy, and birds settling in urban areas initiated nests later, had marginally smaller body sizes and exhibited lower return rates following nest predation than birds in more rural landscapes. In this way, behavioural processes governing habitat selection, settlement patterns and site fidelity probably contributed to the lower levels of reproductive productivity achieved by pairs nesting in urban landscapes. 5. This study provides evidence that the negative association between Acadian flycatchers and urbanization results from both population- and individual-level responses to urbanizing landscapes surrounding their riparian forest habitats.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Patterns of temporary emigration (associated with non-breeding) are important components of variation in individual quality. Permanent emigration from the natal area has important implications for both individual fitness and local population dynamics. 2. We estimated both permanent and temporary emigration of black brent geese (Branta bernicla nigricans Lawrence) from the Tutakoke River colony, using observations of marked brent geese on breeding and wintering areas, and recoveries of ringed individuals by hunters. We used the likelihood developed by Lindberg, Kendall, Hines \& Anderson 2001 (Combining band recovery data and Pollock's robust design to model temporary and permanent emigration. Biometrics, 57, 273-281) to assess hypotheses and estimate parameters. 3. Temporary emigration (the converse of breeding) varied among age classes up to age 5, and differed between individuals that bred in the previous years vs. those that did not. Consistent with the hypothesis of variation in individual quality, individuals with a higher probability of breeding in one year also had a higher probability of breeding the next year. 4. Natal fidelity of females ranged from 0.70 +- 0.07-0.96 +- 0.18 and averaged 0.83. In contrast to Lindberg et al. (1998), we did not detect a relationship between fidelity and local population density. Natal fidelity was negatively correlated with first-year survival, suggesting that competition among individuals of the same age for breeding territories influenced dispersal. Once females nested at the Tutakoke River, colony breeding fidelity was 1.0. 5. Our analyses show substantial variation in individual quality associated with fitness, which other analyses suggest is strongly influenced by early environment. Our analyses also suggest substantial interchange among breeding colonies of brent geese, as first shown by Lindberg et al. (1998).},

  abstract = {Abstract: Global climate change is frequently considered a major conservation threat. The Earth's climate has already warmed by 0.5{\^A}$^\circ$ C over the past century, and recent studies show that it is possible to detect the effects of a changing climate on ecological systems. This suggests that global change may be a current and future conservation threat. Changes in recent decades are apparent at all levels of ecological organization: population and life-history changes, shifts in geographic range, changes in species composition of communities, and changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. These ecological effects can be linked to recent population declines and to both local and global extinctions of species. Although it is impossible to prove that climate change is the cause of these ecological effects, these findings have important implications for conservation biology. It is no longer safe to assume that all of a species' historic range remains suitable. In drawing attention to the importance of climate change as a current threat to species, these studies emphasize the need for current conservation efforts to consider climate change in both in situ conservation and reintroduction efforts. Additional threats will emerge as climate continues to change, especially as climate interacts with other stressors such as habitat fragmentation. These studies can contribute to preparations for future challenges by providing valuable input to models and direct examples of how species respond to climate change.

Gnatcatchers nested earlier, had more successful nests, produced more fledglings, had a longer nesting period, and had tower fledgling costs when their territories were associated with increased grass and forb cover, increased perennial structure, increased horizontal perennial homogeneity, decreased vertical perennial homogeneity, and decreased perennial diversity. Within-territory vegetation variables, derived from the correlation of vegetation and life-history variables, were able to discriminate among gnatcatcher pairs grouped by site. Survival of adult gnatcatchers was significantly higher in the gnatcatcher group that had average within-territory vegetation characteristics associated with maximization of other life-history variables and was significantly lower in the gnatcatcher group that had average within-territory vegetation characteristics associated with minimization of other life-history variables. Survival of juveniles was not associated with within-territory vegetation. The finite rate of population increase (lambda) was gt 1 for the gnatcatcher group where within-territory vegetation and life-history variables were maximized, approximately equal to 1 for gnatcatcher groups where within-territory vegetation and life-history variables were moderate, and lt 1 for the gnatcatcher group where within-territory vegetation and life-history variables were minimal. Our study suggests that within-territory vegetation characteristics are associated with adult survival and lambda, but site characteristics independent of vegetation also could have contributed to such an association.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Nest predation limits avian fitness, so birds should favour nest sites that minimize predation risk. Nevertheless, preferred nest microhabitat features are often uncorrelated with apparent variation in predation rates.
2.\hspace{0.6em}This lack of congruence between theory-based expectation and empirical data may arise when birds already occupy `adaptive peaks'. If birds nest exclusively in low-predation microhabitats, microhabitat and nest predation may no longer be correlated even though predation ultimately shaped microhabitat selection.
3.\hspace{0.6em}This `adaptive peak hypothesis' was tested for a population of Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) focusing on two nest microhabitat features: concealment and height. Experimental nests measured relative predation risk both within and outside the microhabitat range typically occupied by natural nests to examine whether nest site choices made by birds restricted our ability to detect microhabitat effects on predation.
4.\hspace{0.6em}Within the natural range (30\textendash{}80\% concealment, $>$75 cm height), microhabitat\textendash{}predation relationships were weak and inconsistent, and similar for experimental and natural nests. Over an extended range, however, experimental predation rates were elevated in exposed sites ($<$30\% concealed), indicating a concealment-related `adaptive plateau'.
5.\hspace{0.6em}Clay egg bite data revealed a concealment effect on avian predators, and the abundance of one avian predator group correlated with nest concealment among years, suggesting these predators may cue birds to modulate nest concealment choices.
6.\hspace{0.6em}This study demonstrates how avian responses to predation pressure can obscure the adaptive significance of nest site selection, so predation influences may be more important than apparent from published data.},

  abstract = {Merging patterns and processes about the way individuals should be distributed in a habitat is a key issue in the framework of spatial ecology. Here the despotic distribution of individuals in two distinct and neighboring patches within a local population of a long-lived colonial bird, the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis), was assessed. There was no density dependence for suitable habitat at the study population, but behavioral data suggested that birds from the good patch precluded birds from the bad patch from breeding in their patch. Younger breeders were almost exclusively found in the bad patch, where individuals were probably attracted by conspecific attraction from the good patch. Most breeding parameters were lower in the bad patch, resulting mainly from a higher vulnerability to environmental perturbations and a higher rate of intraspecific nest predation. Attempts at breeding dispersal between the two patches were only observed from the bad to the good patch. Strikingly, adult survival and large-scale dispersal, two life history parameters that are very conservative in long-lived organisms, were also more affected at the bad patch when catastrophic predation occurred. The study was consistent with an ideal despotic distribution at small spatial scale, and suggests that individual behavior can influence local population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Using data from 327 nests over a consecutive 8-year period we examined age-specific variation in reproduction in a population of stitchbirds (or hihi) Notiomystis cincta and related how differences in reproductive performance were linked to the timing of territory establishment and breeding. 2. Across the population all reproductive parameters showed a quadratic relationship with an increase mainly between the first and second breeding season and a decline after the fourth year. A longitudinal analysis showed evidence of senescence by the sixth year in the numbers of chicks fledged and recruited. 3. Reproductive increases between years 1 and 2 were the result of poor-quality females dying after their first breeding season (differential selection hypothesis) in combination with surviving females showing improvements in reproduction in their second year (individual improvement/constraint hypothesis). 4. There was no effect of mate experience or territory quality on improvements in breeding between years. 5. The key variable influencing reproductive output was the timing of breeding. Birds that started laying earlier were more likely to lay multiple clutches in any given season. This was the main difference between first-year and older birds; generally first-year birds initiated egg laying later and consequently laid fewer clutches. 6. Approximately half of all first-year birds did not establish their territory until after the breeding season had begun. This delay in territory establishment resulted in these birds delaying breeding, which resulted in them having a lower reproductive output relative to all other birds. First-year birds that managed to establish their territory before breeding commenced, had similar rates of reproduction as older birds. 7. There was a positive relationship between the timing of territory establishment during a female's first year and her hatching date in the previous breeding season. We hypothesize that this was because late-hatched females were less able to effectively compete for territories against earlier-hatched members of their cohort, and this delayed their establishment and breeding in their first year. Thus, this social constraint is likely to be a major factor driving age-specific reproductive variation in this population.

  abstract = {This article highlights how the loose definition of the term 'refugia' has led to discrepancies in methods used to assess the vulnerability of species to the current trend of rising global temperatures. The term 'refugia' is commonly used without distinguishing between macrorefugia and microrefugia, ex situ refugia and in situ refugia, glacial and interglacial refugia or refugia based on habitat stability and refugia based on climatic stability. It is not always clear which definition is being used, and this makes it difficult to assess the appropriateness of the methods employed. For example, it is crucial to develop accurate fine-scale climate grids when identifying microrefugia, but coarse-scale macroclimate might be adequate for determining macrorefugia. Similarly, identifying in situ refugia might be more appropriate for species with poor dispersal ability but this may overestimate the extinction risk for good dispersers. More care needs to be taken to properly define the context when referring to refugia from climate change so that the validity of methods and the conservation significance of refugia can be assessed.},

In response to anticipated effects of climate change, conservation organizations and government agencies are developing "adaptation strategies" to facilitate the adjustment of human society and ecological systems to altered climate regimes. We reviewed the literature and climate-change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, M{\'e}xico, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate-change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change.},

  abstract = {1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.},

  abstract = {I report on the lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of female Eastern Kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus) in central New York. I investigated the major correlates of LRS and specifically tested the hypothesis that small body size yields reproductive benefits. Lifetime reproductive success varied widely: 15\textendash{}20\% of females failed to fledge young over their life, whereas 50\% of young were fledged by 20\% of females. Female lifespan varied between one and eight years, and females that died after one breeding season tended to be smaller-bodied than long-lived females ($\geq$2 seasons). I therefore conducted analyses of LRS for the entire sample and for longer-lived females separately. As in other species, lifespan was the strongest predictor of LRS, followed by the proportion of eggs laid that resulted in fledged young (P). Lifetime reproductive success varied positively with clutch size and, as predicted, inversely with body size (i.e., tarsus length) of females. However, variance partitioning indicated that most variation in LRS was attributable to the effects of lifespan and P, but that a substantial negative covariance existed between lifespan and P. The latter result was consistent with experimental evidence of a cost of reproduction in Eastern Kingbirds. Analysis of the correlates of lifespan, P, and clutch size showed that over a female's lifetime, (1) the longest-lived birds fledged an intermediate proportion of the eggs that they laid, (2) the most productive birds were of intermediate wing length, and (3) females with small tarsi produced the largest clutches and lost the fewest nests to predators. Hence, although lifespan was the dominant influence on LRS, negative effects of large female size appeared to be expressed through the influence of body size on other demographic parameters that contribute to LRS.},

We evaluated the performance of several versions of multinomial regression, plus Poisson and normal regression, for analysis of count data with means $<$2 through Monte Carlo simulations. Simulated data mimicked observed counts of number of young fledged (0, 1, 2, or 3) by California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). We considered size and power of tests to detect differences among 10 levels of a categorical predictor, as well as tests for trends across 10-year periods. We found regular regression and analysis of variance procedures based on a normal distribution to perform satisfactorily in all cases we considered, whereas failure rate of multinomial procedures was often excessively high, and the Poisson model demonstrated inappropriate test size for data where the variance/mean ratio was $<$1 or $>$1.2. Thus, managers can use simple statistical methods with which they are likely already familiar to analyze the kinds of count data we described here.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In migrant birds, winter social systems reflect strategies of habitat use. The best-studied strategy is that of a fixed home range or territory. Alternative strategies to holding a territory, such as floating and flocking behaviors, suggest different processes of habitat selection. Whereas flocking, like territoriality, is a well-studied social strategy, solitary nonterritorial (floater) behavior is difficult to study and is thus poorly understood in terms of its causes, consequences, and implications for habitat selection. Floaters are individuals of a primarily stationary population which move over large areas compared to the average home range size. We review evidence of the causes, consequences, and frequency of winter floating behavior, focusing primarily on migrant songbirds. We also address the endocrine basis of alternative behavioral strategies by presenting results from aviary-based dominance trials with Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus). Results from this study and others suggest that the adrenocortical response to social stress plays a key role in both the proximate and ultimate causes of floating behavior. Because winter floating behavior exists in many migrant songbird species, better understanding of winter floaters may be important for population modeling and conservation planning.},

ecology, medicine, or even market research, that commonly deal with dendrogram-based

dendrogram-based analyses require adequate measurement for assessing of which of the
clustering methods preserves most faithfully the initial dissimilarity matrix. While cophenetic
correlation coefficient-based measures have been widely used for this purpose, we emphasize
here that it is not always a suitable approach. We thus propose a measure based on a matrix
norm, the 2-norm, to adequately check which of the resulting ultrametric distance matrices
related to the dendrograms is the closest to the initial dissimilarity matrix. In addition, we also
propose an objective way to define a benchmark value (threshold value) in order to assess
whether the degree of conformity between the ultrametric distance matrix selected and the
initial dissimilarity matrix is satisfactory. Our proposal may notably be incorporated within a
recently proposed approach that involves the use of clustering methods in environmental
science and beyond. In ecology, various functional diversity indices based on clustering species
from their functional dissimilarities may benefit from this overall approach.},

  abstract = {The southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) is a federally endangered subspecies that breeds in increasingly fragmented and threatened habitat. We examined whether temporal and habitat characteristics were associated with risk of predation and probability of brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) on flycatcher nests at 6 sites in southern Nevada and northwestern Arizona, USA. For nest predation, we found the most support for a model that included date and an interaction between parasitism status and nesting stage. Daily nest survival decreased from 0.87 (95\% CI\,=\,0.81\textendash{}0.93) to 0.78 (95\% CI\,=\,0.72\textendash{}0.84) through the season for parasitized nests but remained relatively constant for unparasitized nests (0.93, 95\% CI\,=\,0.91\textendash{}0.95 to 0.92, 95\% CI\,=\,0.91\textendash{}93). Parasitized nests had lower survival than non-parasitized nests during the incubation (0.85, 95\% CI\,=\,0.84\textendash{}0.86 vs. 0.92, CI\,=\,0.91\textendash{}0.93) and nestling (0.79, 95\% CI\,=\,0.77\textendash{}0.81 vs. 0.91, 95\% CI\,=\,0.90\textendash{}0.92) stages. Of the variables included in our parasitism candidate models, model-averaged coefficients and odds ratios supported only distance to habitat edge; odds of parasitism decreased 1\% for every 1\,m from the habitat edge. Nests greater than 100\,m from an edge were 50\% less likely to be parasitized as those on an edge, however, only 52 of 233 nests (22\%) were found at this distance. Where management and conservation goals include reducing nest losses due to parasitism, we recommend restoration of habitat patches that minimize edge and maximize breeding habitat further from edges. At sites where cowbirds have been documented as important nest predators, controlling cowbirds may be one option, but further study of the link between parasitism and nest predation and the identification of major nest predators at specific sites is warranted. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Frugivores disperse the seeds of the majority of woody plant species world-wide. Thus, insights on how frugivores influence the dispersal of plants and the variability of this process are crucial for understanding plant population dynamics in a rapidly changing world. 2. We used a spatially explicit, stochastic, individual-based model that simulates fruit-removal and seed dispersal by birds to assess bird density, landscape and neighbourhood effects on the inequalities of within-population fruit-removal rates and seed dispersal. We also compared model predictions with spatially-explicit field data. 3. In our simulations, bird density had a strong effect on the distribution of fruit-removal rates creating large inequalities among plants. Also, for equal bird densities, inequalities increased with the landscape level aggregation of plants. 4. Fruit removal increased with increasing plant neighbourhood density although there was a tendency to decline at the highest densities. Neighbourhood density also changed average dispersal distances, but with shorter distances at higher densities. Plants with few neighbours not only had longer distance dispersal but also a larger variance in seed rain across distances than plants with ten or more neighbours. These relationships between neighbourhood density and fruit removal and dispersal distance were scale-dependent with a peak in correlations at 150-m radius. 5. Similar to model predictions, field data shows an inverse relationship between dispersal distances (inferred from bird movements) and fruiting neighbourhood density. Also, fruit-removal rates observed in the field show large numbers of plants receiving little or zero fruit-removal. Fruit-removal rate distributions were statistically indistinguishable between the simulation and field data. But, distributions were strikingly different from two alternative models that lacked spatial effects. 6. Synthesis. Our model and field data show that as fruiting plants become aggregated, inequalities in fruit-removal rates increase and seed dispersal distance decreases. Both of these processes could help create and maintain plant aggregation and affect genetic structuring. The model also predicts that small-scale neighbourhood effects can be controlled by large-scale processes such as overall frugivore abundance and landscape-level plant aggregation. Most importantly, both simulations and field data shows an interaction between plant spatial pattern and bird foraging, which results in neighbourhood-specific dispersal and rates of fruit removal.},

  abstract = {Recent climate change has caused comparatively rapid shifts in the phenology and geographic distributions of many plants and animals. However, there is debate over the degree to which populations can meet the challenges of climate change with evolutionary or phenotypic responses in life history and morphology. We report that migrating birds captured at a banding station in western Pennsylvania, USA, have exhibited steadily decreasing fat-free mass and wing chord since 1961, consistent with a response to a warmer climate. This confirms that phenotypic responses to climate change are currently underway in entire avian assemblages. Declines in body size were not explained by an index of habitat condition within the breeding or wintering distributions. Instead, size was negatively correlated with temperature in the previous year, and long-term trends were associated with the direction of natural selection acting on size over the winter: species undergoing the strongest selection favoring small wing chord showed the most rapid long-term declines in wing. Phenotypic changes are therefore in line with the prevailing selection regime.},

  abstract = {Aim: To compare bird abundances in woodlands along gradients from the city centre to the peri-urban area. To evaluate the importance of the proportion of woodland within the city and in the peri-urban landscape to forest bird communities breeding in urban woodlands. To test whether fragmentation effects on birds were linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. Location: A total of 34 Swedish cities with $>$ 10,000 inhabitants in south-central Sweden. The study area covered 105,000 km2, in which 84\% of the Swedish population of 9.1 million lives. Methods: Repeated point count surveys were conducted in 2004 in a total of 474 woodlands. General linear models were used to test for possible differences in abundance along urban to peri-urban gradients, and to regress bird abundances in local urban woodlands on: (1) total woodland cover in the city, (2) total woodland cover in the peri-urban landscape, (3) the interaction between woodland cover in the city and in the peri-urban area, (4) region, and (5) human density.Results: More than 12,000 individuals of 100 forest bird species were recorded. Of the 34 most common species detected, 13 bird species had higher abundances in urban than in peri-urban woodlands, and seven species showed the opposite trend. The bird community of urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with deciduous forests and tree nesters, whereas the bird community of peri-urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with coniferous woodland and ground nesters. Twelve species were significantly linearly associated with the proportion of urban woodland and/or the proportion of peri-urban woodland, and a further eight species were associated with the interaction between these two factors. Local breeding bird abundances of four species were significantly positively associated with the proportion of urban woodland only in farmland-dominated landscapes.Main conclusions: Fragmentation effects on some urban birds are linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. In farmland landscapes, peri-urban woodlands may have been too scarce to act as a source of bird immigrants to fragmented urban woodlands. To maintain populations of specialized forest birds within cities in landscapes dominated by agriculture, it is of paramount importance to conserve any remaining urban woodlands.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the manner in which ecological communities respond during a time of decreasing precipitation is a first step in understanding how they will respond to longer-term climate change. Here we coupled analysis of interannual variability in remotely sensed data with analyses of bird and butterfly community changes in montane meadow communities of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Landsat satellite imagery was used to classify these meadows into six types along a hydrological gradient. The northern portion of the ecosystem, or Gallatin region, has smaller mean patch sizes separated by ridges of mountains, whereas the southern portion of the ecosystem, or Teton region, has much larger patches within the Jackson Hole valley. Both support a similar suite of butterfly and bird species. The Gallatin region showed more overall among-year variation in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) when meadow types were pooled within regions, perhaps because the patch sizes are smaller on average. Bird and butterfly communities showed significant relationships relative to meadow type and NDVI. We identified several key species that are tightly associated with specific meadow types along the hydrological gradient. Comparing taxonomic groups, fewer birds showed specific habitat affinities than butterflies, perhaps because birds are responding to differences in habitat structure among meadow types and using the landscape at a coarser scale than the butterflies. Comparing regions, the Teton region showed higher predictability of community assemblages as compared to the Gallatin region. The Gallatin region exhibited more significant temporal trends with respect to butterflies. Butterfly communities in wet meadows showed a distinctive shift along the hydrological gradient during a drought period (1997-2000). These results imply that the larger Teton meadows will show more predictable (i.e., static) species-habitat associations over the long term, but that the smaller Gallatin meadows may be an area that will exhibit the effects of global climate change faster.},

  abstract = {Four thrush species are sympatric in the central Appalachians: Veery (Catharus fuscescens), Hermit Thrush (C. guttatus), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius). The four species often nest near one another, which suggests that habitat partitioning may have developed to minimize past interspecific competition. Our objectives were to determine which specific characteristics of nesting habitat were partitioned among the species and to evaluate the relationship of these characteristics to nest survival. We monitored nests and sampled habitat variables at three spatial scales: nest substrate, nest site, and territory. A multivariate analysis of variance indicated a difference (P $<$ 0.01) in the nest sites of all species and in each pairwise species contrast. An analysis of variance and Fisher's exact tests detected differences (P $<$ 0.05) among species in 21 of 36 variables measured. Classification tree analysis correctly classified nests by species at a rate better than would be expected at random. Habitat partitioning among the four thrush species occurred at all three scales sampled, with the most important partitioning variables being nest height, distance-to-edge, sapling density, and elevation. Mayfield logistic regression found a positive relationship (P $<$ 0.05) between decreasing nest height and American Robin nest survival. Overall, nest survival was similar among the four thrush species examined, and most of the variables that we measured were unrelated to survival.},

Quantifying the pattern of temporal and spatial variation in demography, and identifying the factors that cause this variation, are essential steps towards understanding the structure and dynamics of any population. 2. One critical but understudied demographic rate is pre-breeding survival. We used long-term colour-ringing data to quantify temporal (among-year) and spatial (among-nest site) variation in pre-breeding survival in red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) inhabiting Islay, Scotland, and identified environmental correlates of this variation. 3. Random-effects capture-mark-recapture models demonstrated substantial temporal and spatial process variance in first-year survival; survival from fledging to age 1 year varied markedly among choughs fledged in different years and fledged from different nest sites. Spatial variance exceeded temporal variance across choughs fledged from well-studied nest sites. 4. The best-supported models of temporal variation suggested that first-year survival was higher in years following high tipulid larvae abundance and when weather conditions favoured increased invertebrate productivity and/or availability to foraging choughs. These variables explained up to 80\% of estimated temporal process variance. 5. The best-supported models of spatial variation suggested that first-year survival was higher in choughs fledged from nest sites that were further from exposed coasts and closer to flocking areas, and surrounded by better habitat and higher chough density. These variables explained up to 40\% of estimated spatial process variance. 6. Importantly, spatio-temporal models indicated interactive effects of weather, tipulid abundance, local habitat and local chough density on first-year survival, suggesting that detrimental effects of poor weather and low tipulid abundance may be reduced in choughs fledged from nest sites surrounded by better foraging habitat and lower chough density. 7. These analyses demonstrate substantial temporal and small-scale spatial variation in pre-breeding survival, a key demographic rate, and indicate that this variation may reflect interactive effects of weather, prey abundance, habitat and geography. These patterns illustrate the value of holistic models of demographic variation, and indicate environmental factors that may limit the growth rate of Islay's protected chough population.},

  abstract = {I provide a brief introduction to the concept of spatial autocorrelation and its incorporation into regression-type models. Spatial autocorrelation occurs when the response variable is correlated with itself at other locations in the region of interest. The autocorrelation usually takes a specific form where observations close in space are more correlated than those farther apart, and the rate of decay of the correlation is a function of the distance separating 2 locations. I present 2 commonly used models: 1) geostatistical modeling in which data are collected at points in the study region and 2) conditional autoregression (lattice) models in which data are aggregated over small nonoverlapping sub-areas of the study region. I also describe incorporation of explanatory covariates, such as habitat or physico-chemical attributes. I emphasize frequentist methods, but I briefly describe Bayesian approaches. I also provide some advantages, such as obtaining correct standard errors for estimators, and disadvantages, such as requirements for larger sample sizes, of incorporating spatial autocorrelation into the modeling effort. This information can aid researchers in designing and analyzing models of the relationships between species distributions and habitat. As a result, more informative models can be developed which further aid in management of wildlife.},

  abstract = {The effects of visits to nests by researchers interested in quantifying avian nesting success have received considerable attention, as researchers have long been concerned about the possible negative effects of their own activities on the resulting estimates. There is a widely held view that investigator disturbance has an overall negative effect on breeding success by increasing nest predation rates in the nests studied. However, to date no one has statistically assessed the empirical evidence for such a relationship. We undertook a meta-analysis of published results to assess whether researcher activities increase nest predation in birds. We also assessed the variability in this effect in relation to the traits of the study species and the methodology used. These analyses used data from 18 experimental studies involving 25 species from six avian orders. Our results suggest that, contrary to the traditional view, researcher activities do not generally affect the incidence of nest predation. Moreover, this relationship appears inconsistent among avian orders and, surprisingly, nest survival of passerines increased weakly with researcher activities. We also found significant positive effects of researcher activity on nest survival for species breeding on coastal areas and for species nesting on the ground. The possible explanation for these differences among orders and guilds could be due to different nest predator communities. This new perspective on the effect of investigators could have important implications for bird management and conservation, as well as for other fields of study such as ecology and evolution, in which nest survival rates measured in the field are widely used to test and support a range of hypotheses.},

  abstract = {1. Resource selection functions (RSFs) are becoming a dominant tool in habitat selection studies.
RSF coefficients can be estimated with unconditional (standard) and conditional logistic regressions.
While the advantage of mixed-effects models is recognized for standard logistic regression,
mixed conditional logistic regression remains largely overlooked in ecological studies.
2. We demonstrate the significance of mixed conditional logistic regression for habitat selection
studies. First, we use spatially explicit models to illustrate how mixed-effects RSFs can be useful in
the presence of inter-individual heterogeneity in selection and when the assumption of independence
from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is violated. The IIA hypothesis states that the strength of
preference for habitat type A over habitat type B does not depend on the other habitat types also
available. Secondly, we demonstrate the significance of mixed-effects models to evaluate habitat
selection of free-ranging bison Bison bison.
3. When movement rules were homogeneous among individuals and the IIA assumption was
respected, fixed-effects RSFs adequately described habitat selection by simulated animals. In situations
violating the inter-individual homogeneity and IIA assumptions, however, RSFs were best
estimated with mixed-effects regressions, and fixed-effects models could even provide faulty conclusions.
4. Mixed-effects models indicate that bison did not select farmlands, but exhibited strong interindividual
variations in their response to farmlands. Less than half of the bison preferred farmlands
over forests. Conversely, the fixed-effect model simply suggested an overall selection for
farmlands.
5. Conditional logistic regression is recognized as a powerful approach to evaluate habitat selection
when resource availability changes. This regression is increasingly used in ecological studies,
but almost exclusively in the context of fixed-effects models. Fitness maximization can imply differences
in trade-offs among individuals, which can yield inter-individual differences in selection
and lead to departure from IIA. These situations are best modelled with mixed-effects models.
Mixed-effects conditional logistic regression should become a valuable tool for ecological
research.},

Cluster analysis of a Euclidean distance matrix, based on the nesting substrate and mean values of nest-site measurements, identified three nesting assemblages comprising species nesting primarily in trees (six species), shrubs (four), or herbaceous cover (three). Discriminant canonical analyses were used to elucidate relationships among species within each nesting group. Two canonical axes separated most species nesting in trees along gradients of (I) nest and support-structure height and (II) support-limb diameter, distance to periphery of substrate, and nest height. Nest sites of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) were not different (P $>$ 0.05) from those of Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata) and Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura), which did differ from each other. Two canonical axes, representing (I) nest and support-structure height and (II) support-limb diameter and cover at the nest, separated all shrub-nesting species except Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum).

Species with similar nest sites tended to have different habitat use patterns. Nest-site analysis should be considered when investigating intra-community relationships among birds.},

First, we created distribution and abundance models for common bird species using climate, elevation, and tree species variables and modeled how bird distributions might change as habitats shift. Second, we assessed potential effects on high-elevation birds, especially Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli), that may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, by using statistical associations between climate, spruce-fir forest vegetation and bird survey data. Last, we complemented these projections with an assessment of how habitat quality of a migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) might be affected by climate change. Large changes in bird communities of the Northeast are likely to result from climate change, and these changes will be most dramatic under a scenario of continued high emissions. Indeed, high-elevation bird species may currently be at the threshold of critical change with as little as 1$^\circ$C warming reducing suitable habitat by more than half. Species at mid elevations are likely to experience declines in habitat quality that could affect demography. Although not all species will be affected adversely, some of the Northeast's iconic species, such as common loon and black-capped chickadee, and some of its most abundant species, including several neotropical migrants, are projected to decline significantly in abundance under all climate change scenarios. No clear mitigation strategies are apparent, as shifts in species' abundances and ranges will occur across all habitat types and for species with widely differing ecologies.},

  abstract = {Aim?Mechanistic models of old-field plant succession have generally lacked a broader biogeographic context in which climate, soils and species pools could play a significant role in mediating succession rates. We examine broad-scale patterns in old-field succession and introduce a hierarchical conceptual model to incorporate potential mechanisms operating at multiple spatial scales.Location? We reviewed secondary succession studies across the Eastern Deciduous Forest (EDF) of North America.Methods? We collected data from all published studies that reported the time necessary for woody species to reach either 10\% or 50\% cover in old-field systems throughout the EDF. We used regression approaches to determine whether rates of succession are controlled by climatic and edaphic factors that vary at broad spatial scales.Results? We found that the rate at which woody species colonize and dominate old fields decreases significantly with latitude. Rates of woody succession were highly correlated with both annual temperature (growing degree-days for years to 10\% and 50\% cover) and measures of soil fertility (cation exchange capacity and reported pre-agroindustrial (1930) maize yields for years to 10\% cover), all of which show a significant latitudinal trend across the EDF.Main conclusions? We suggest that the driver of this pattern is geographic variation in the intensity of competition between herbaceous and woody species, which we relate to the effects of (1) temperature regime, (2) edaphic factors related to soil fertility, and (3) plant traits, which may vary latitudinally in response to climate and edaphic factors. Although insufficient data exist to evaluate the relative importance of these factors, we argue that research in this area is necessary to gain an understanding of how future landscapes will be affected by global climate and land use change.},

  abstract = {1.The timing of phenological events, as flowering time in plants or migration and breeding time in animals, is related to environmental conditions, e.g. local ambient temperature, and varies considerably between years. The relationship between the relevant environmental condition(s) and phenology can be described by a reaction norm. 2.Apart from variation among years phenology also varies geographically and the timing of phenological events is generally later at higher latitudes. However, whether this latitudinal trend is caused by a single reaction norm (and locally varying conditions) or whether reaction norms differ spatially is largely unknown. 3.Avian breeding time is determined by a variety of internal and external factors, e.g. photoperiod and temperature. The corresponding reaction norms are normally described by a regression of annual mean against temperatures averaged over a certain period. We circumvented problems inherent in this approach by using proportional hazards models to describe the relationship between breeding time and local temperature and day length. 4.The proportional hazards model describes a 'time to event', e.g. survival or in this case time until laying of the first egg, by modelling the probability that the event will occur per unit time as a function of an unspecified baseline hazard and fixed or time-dependent variables. Any variable that changes its value during the 'time to event', e.g. ambient temperature, can be included as time-dependent variable. 5.Applying this approach to a large data set of Finnish great tit (Parus major) egg laying dates from populations spanning about 700km in latitude, we found that temperature- and day length-reaction norms vary with latitude. 6.Optimal reaction norms likely differ between populations and the observed variation in reaction norms among populations may thus reflect local adaptation. Under environmental change, local reaction norms may become suboptimal, and latitude-specific breeding time reaction norms may represent a source of variation that could benefit a species to adapt to such changes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

Here, we evaluate the performance of the Mantel test for two applications in comparative biology: testing for phylogenetic signal, and testing for an evolutionary correlation between two characters. We find that the Mantel test has poor performance compared to alternative methods, including low power and, under some circumstances, inflated type-I error. We identify a remedy for the inflated type-I error of three-way Mantel tests using phylogenetic permutations; however, this test still has considerably lower power than independent contrasts. We recommend that use of the Mantel test should be restricted to cases in which data can only be expressed as pairwise distances among taxa.},

  abstract = {Context Annual migration of landbirds across the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) presents a unique opportunity to examine extrinsic processes operating at various spatial scales in determining animal distributions. Objectives Our objectives were to comprehensively quantify bird stopover densities across the northern GOM coast and model broad-scale factors explaining distributional patterns. Methods We used weather surveillance radars to measure reflectivity of birds aloft at onset of nocturnal migratory flights and estimate bird stopover densities during four springs (2009\textendash{}2012) for 6.7 million ha along the GOM. We aggregated bird densities to one longitudinal degree and 3 km of proximity to coast. Results Boosted Regression Tree models revealed that stopover density was related to year, longitude, proximity to coast, and amount of hardwood forest cover in the landscape. Average longitudinal patterns supported previous studies of broad-scale trans-Gulf migrant arrivals with highest density in Louisiana (92\textendash{}93$^\circ$W) and lowest in Alabama (88\textendash{}89$^\circ$W). Florida (83\textendash{}84$^\circ$W) supported a second peak in migrant density, suggesting an eastern trans-Gulf route or contribution from trans-Caribbean migrants. Longitudinal patterns in migrant distributions varied strongly between years and appear generally related to variability in GOM wind patterns. Densities increased with proximity to coast, highlighting constraints on migrants to travel inland, especially in Florida's panhandle. Despite this, density was positively related to amount of forest cover more steeply along the immediate coast. Conclusions Broad-scale stopover distributions of migrating landbirds along the GOM coast are heavily influenced by geographic constraints in the context of the GOM acting as a barrier to landbird migration.},

  shorttitle = {Nest Building under the Risk of Predation},
  abstract = {Nest predation is a widespread demographic and evolutionary force in avian reproduction, but few studies have considered the circumstances under which birds might invest in the construction of safe nests. We examined this question using a stochastic simulation model based on a basic passerine breeding season. Nest safety functions were used to translate time invested in nest building into an increase in daily nest survival; that increase could be rapid, requiring only a few days to achieve a safe nest, or slow, taking many days to do so. The maximum achievable safety differed across nest safety functions. Given a limited length to the breeding season, a greater time investment in nest safety detracts from the time available for re-nesting following successful or unsuccessful nesting attempts. In many circumstances, the best option is a quick-build ``minimal'' nest that provides adequate support for young, but little additional safety from attacks. This is especially true for scenarios that allow for multiple nesting attempts across a season. However, relatively safe nests that can be built fairly quickly are uniformly favored options. Safe, long-build nests are favored only when they provide a great deal of safety over other nest-building options, but greater safety alone is not sufficient for such investment. Simulations allowing only a single nesting attempt generally favor a greater investment in nest safety. Parental survival is another important factor in nest investment. Increased danger to the parent during nest building strongly favors a low investment in nests. However, substantial investment in a safe nest is favored when that safety extends to the incubating parent. Our results provide some insight into the prevalence of seemingly unsafe, open-cup nests across the bird world, but the range of nest types that could potentially be built by a given species is an open question.
