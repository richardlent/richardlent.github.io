	abstract = {The inornate ringlet butterfly, Coenonympha inornata, is highly constrained by temperature in its activity, and even on sunny days may spend a major portion of its time grounded. Thermoregulation in these lateral baskers can consume the major portion of their time; males alternate between basking and flying, and at 16 degrees C spend 73\% of their time basking and only 27\% of their time flying. At high ambient temperatures (Ta), on the other hand, they spend most ({\textgreater} 80\%) of their time in flight. Active butterflies were followed for up to 52 min in the field to determine foraging behavior, mating success, and time investments for thermoregulation. Foraging was a minor component of their flight activity. Most of the flight activity was associated with mate-seeking. Thoracic temperatures were measured in the field on individuals tethered to thermocouples that permitted flight and basking behavior. Basking at low Ta allowed the maintenance of higher thoracic temperatures than could be maintained in continuous flight, and the butterflies then adopted a sit-and-wait strategy in mate chasing. In contrast, at high Ta they used a search strategy for mate seeking instead.},

abstract="The level of genetic diversity found for species is strongly influenced by properties of the species' ecology, abundance and behaviour (as dispersal). To address this coherence, we selected twenty-two grassland butterfly and burnet moth species, which were previously analysed by allozyme electrophoresis (using 15--25 loci per species) over a study area in western Germany with adjoining areas of Luxembourg and north-eastern France. For this study area, we calculated the species' specific climatic niche breadths and derived various ecological parameters from literature and own field observations. The obtained parameters of genetic diversity (heterozygosity, number of alleles and percentage of polymorphic loci), genetic differentiation (D                est as well as F                ST and F                IS values as proxis for genetic differentiation among populations and inbreeding within populations), as well as ecological and climatic niche dimensions did not show significant differences among the different Lepidoptera families; therefore taxonomic assignment apparently has a negligible influence on the genetic structure of taxa. Genetic diversity and differentiation showed a significant correlation with the ecological and climatic niche-breadth of species in many cases: generalistic species with rather unspecific ecological characteristics and climatic niche had higher genetic diversities and tend to have lower differentiation and inbreeding, whereas specialist taxa (i.e. with narrow ecological and climatic niches) have lower genetic diversities and higher differentiation and inbreeding. The results might reflect contrasting population structures of specialist species with lower abundances compared with the more common generalists. The more restricted and isolated occurrence of specialists might consequence a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in genetic differentiation among local populations. In contrast, generalists with unspecific habitat requirements occur in higher abundances and in consequence show a more homogenous genetic structure with higher diversities.",

	abstract = {Decisions regarding species status of taxa showing geographic replacement are explicit hypotheses about population structure. The structure of 21 populations of the Coenonympha tullia group from northern California, southwestern Oregon, and northern Nevada was analyzed for evidence of reproductive isolation. These samples included five subspecies (california, eryngii, ampelos, eunomia, and mono) nominally placed in three species (california, ampelos, and ochracea). We found very high intra- and inter-population variability in the "diagnostic" wing pattern characters used by previous authors. There is evidence of intergradation between eryngii and eunomia in southwestern Oregon, and between california and ampelos in the eastern Feather River drainage in California. A complex cline involving California, eryngii, and ampelos occurs in the Pit River drainage of northeastern California. The taxon mono appears distinct, apparently because of an absence of Coenonympha populations in the expected mono-ampelos contact area. Electrophoretic analysis of the same 21 populations showed very high intrapopulation genetic variability (expected heterozygosity = 13.5-20.4\%, percentage of polymorphic loci (most common allele {\textless} 99\%) = 35.5-58.8\%; 14 alleles at the locus for phosphoglucose isomerase (one population with 11 alleles)). However, interpopulation (geographic) variability was extremely low. Standardized genetic variance among populations (FST, using Wright's formulation) in contact zones indicates that gene flow is probably uninterrupted between the sub-species california, eryngii, ampelos, and eunomia. FST values for the isocitrate dehydrogenase locus indicate that present-day gene flow is probably unimportant in maintaining similarity between ampelos and mono. The genetic population structure is reminiscent of highly vagile colonizing species, but this may be largely historical, due to post-Pleistocene range changes rather than high present-day interpopulation migration rates. We conclude that all California populations are conspecific. Only the subspecies mono is clearly separated from the others, at the level 0.034 (Nei's unbiased distance), approximating that of weak subspecies in other taxa. The North American entities should all be provisionally classified as subspecies of the holarctic species tullia unless evidence is found to support their separation.},

Patterns of habitat patch occupancy and local density in the three species support the general predictions of metapopulation models.

The model is tested with independent data on H. comma and P. argus, for which it predicts the rate and pattern of spread into networks of vacant habitat patches following introduction or natural recolonization. The model can be used to assess the potential of specific networks of habitat patches to support viable metapopulations of given species, and it therefore has great potential value for conservation of butterflies and other species which occur as systems of interconnected small populations.},

Relationship between factors correlated to butterfly diversity; Failure of land-use focused model to predict butterfly diversity; Need to use species richness distribution maps produced by predictive modelling as pro-active conservation tools.
We evaluate differences between and the applicability of three linear predictive models to determine butterfly hotspots in Belgium for nature conservation purposes. The study is carried out in Belgium for records located to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells of 5 X 5 km. We first determine the relationship between factors correlated to butterfly diversity by means of modified t-tests and principal components analysis; subsequently, we predict hotspots using linear models based on land use, climate and topographical variables of well-surveyed UTM grid cells ( n = 197). The well-surveyed squares are divided into a training set and an evaluation set to test the model predictions. We apply three different models: (1) a 'statistically focused' model where variables are entered in descending order of statistical significance, (2) a 'land use-focused' model where land use variables known to be related to butterfly diversity are forced into the model and (3) a 'hybrid' model where the variables of the 'land use-focused model' are entered first and subsequently complemented by the remaining variables entered in descending order of statistical significance. A principal components analyses reveals that climate, and to a large extent, land use are locked into topography, and that topography and climate are the variables most strongly correlated with butterfly diversity in Belgium. In the statistically focused model, biogeographical region alone explains 65\% of the variability; other variables entering the statistically focused model are the area of coniferous and deciduous woodland, elevation and the number of frost days; the statistically focused model explains 77\% of the variability in the training set and 66\% in the evaluation set.

	abstract = {Climate change and habitat fragmentation are considered key pressures on biodiversity. In this paper we explore the potential synergetic effects between these factors. We argue that processes at two levels of spatial scale interact: the metapopulation level and the species range level. Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion. Taking into account the effects of climate change on metapopulations, habitat distribution and land use changes, future biodiversity research and conservation strategies are facing the challenge to re-orient their focus and scope by integrating spatially and conceptually more dynamic aspects at the landscape level.},

	abstract = {Determining the permeability of different types of landscape matrices to animal movement is essential for conserving populations in fragmented landscapes. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size and matrix type on diversity, isolation, and dispersal of ithomiine butterflies in forest fragments surrounded by coffee agroecosystems in the Colombian Andes. Because ithomiines prefer a shaded understory, we expected the highest diversity and abundance in large fragments surrounded by shade coffee and the lowest in small fragments surrounded by sun coffee. We also thought shade coffee would favor butterfly dispersal and immigration into forest patches. We marked 9675 butterflies of 39 species in 12 forest patches over a year. Microclimate conditions were more similar to the forest interior in the shade-coffee matrix than in the sun-coffee matrix, but patch size and matrix type did not affect species richness and abundance in forest fragments. Furthermore, age structure and temporal recruitment patterns of the butterfly community were similar in all fragments, independent of patch size or matrix type. There were no differences in the numbers of butterflies flying in the matrices at two distances from the forest patch, but their behavior differed. Flight in the sun-coffee matrix was rapid and directional, whereas butterflies in shade-coffee matrix flew slowly. Seven out of 130 recaptured butterflies immigrated into patches in the shade-coffee matrix, and one immigrated into a patch surrounded by sun coffee. Although the shade-coffee matrix facilitated movement in the landscape, sun-coffee matrix was not impermeable to butterflies. Ithomiines exhibited behavioral plasticity in habitat use and high mobility. These traits favor their persistence in heterogeneous landscapes, opening opportunities for their conservation. Understanding the dynamics and resource requirements of different organisms in rural landscapes is critical for identifying management options that address both animals' and farmers' needs. La determinaciÃ³n de la permeabilidad de diferentes tipos de matrices de paisaje al movimiento de animales es esencial para la conservaciÃ³n de poblaciones en paisajes fragmentados. Evaluamos los efectos del tamaÃ±o del fragmento de hÃ¡bitat y el tipo de matriz sobre la diversidad, aislamiento y dispersiÃ³n de mariposas ithomiinae en fragmentos de bosque rodeados por agroecosistemas cafeteros en los Andes colombianos. Debido a que estas mariposas prefieren un sotobosque sombreado, esperamos mayor diversidad en fragmentos grandes rodeados por cafÃ© de sombra y menor diversidad en fragmentos pequeÃ±os rodeados por cafÃ© de sol. TambiÃ©n pensamos que el cafÃ© de sombra favorecerÃ­a la dispersiÃ³n e inmigraciÃ³n a fragmentos de bosque. Marcamos 9675 mariposas de 39 especies en 12 fragmentos a lo largo de un aÃ±o. Las condiciones microclimÃ¡ticas fueron mÃ¡s similares al interior del bosque en el cafÃ© de sombra que en la matriz de cafÃ© de sol, pero el tamaÃ±o del fragmento y el tipo de matriz no afectaron la riqueza y abundancia de especies en los fragmentos de bosque. MÃ¡s aun, la estructura de edades y los patrones de reclutamiento temporal de la comunidad de mariposas fueron similares en todos los fragmentos, independientemente del tamaÃ±o del fragmento o el tipo de matriz. No hubo diferencias en los nÃºmeros de mariposas volando en las matrices a dos distancias del fragmento de bosque, pero su conducta fue diferente. El vuelo en la matriz de cafÃ© de sol fue rÃ¡pido y direccional, mientras que en el cafÃ© de sombra las mariposas volaban lentamente. Siete de 130 mariposas recapturadas inmigraron a fragmentos en la matriz de cafÃ© de sombra y una inmigrÃ³ a un parche rodeado por cafÃ© de sol. Aunque la matriz de cafÃ© de sombra facilitÃ³ el movimiento en el paisaje, el cafÃ© de sol no fue impermeable a las mariposas. Las mariposas mostraron plasticidad conductual en el uso del hÃ¡bitat y alta movilidad. Estas caracterÃ­sticas favorecen su persistencia en paisajes heterogÃ©neos, lo que abre oportunidades para su conservaciÃ n. El entendimiento de la dinÃ¡mica y los requerimientos de recursos de los diferentes organismos en paisajes rurales es crÃ­tico para la identificaciÃ³n de opciones de manejo que aborden las necesidades tanto de los animales como de los campesinos.},

	abstract = {In nature, organisms experience environmental variability at coarse-grained (inter-generational) and fine-grained (intra-generational) scales and a common response to environmental variation is phenotypic plasticity. The emphasis of most empirical work on plasticity has been on examining coarse-grained variation with the goal of understanding the costs and benefits of plastic responses in response to a particular environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of fine-grained variation in predation on the inducible defences of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) by widely altering the density and feeding schedule of caged predators (Dytiscus spp.) while holding average predation constant. We found that predator cues induced change in tadpole behaviour, morphology, and mass. Surprisingly, however, temporal variation in predation did not cause the tadpoles to alter their activity (compared to a constant predation treatment) or mass. Temporal variation in predation did alter tadpole tail depth, but only when experiencing our most extreme variation treatment in which the predators were fed once every 8?days. Under these conditions, the predator-induced tadpole tail was less extreme compared to environments containing constant predation. While a number of previous studies have examined behavioural responses of prey to temporal variation in predation risk without holding average predation constant, this appears to be the first test of temporal variation per se. As in previous studies of organism responses to temporal variation in resources, our results suggest that fine-grained environmental variability can affect the expression of phenotypically plastic traits, but our tadpoles appear to be generally unresponsive to this fine-grained variation for many of their traits.},

Introduction of a spatial dimension into a discrete-time Markov chain leads to a class of cellular automata called spatio-temporal Markov chains (STMC). The behaviour of the model is determined by its temporal and spatial orders. It has been proven that STMC models have ergodic distributions in certain cases for spatial order 0. Simulations suggest that STMC models of higher spatial order also have ergodic distributions. The model of Dytham (1995) is demonstrated to be an STMC. Modelling population dynamics of three plant species on a lawn, two STMC models of different order are compared. The model validation shows a good agreement for Glechoma hederacea, but large deviations for Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens. The species-dependent performance of the models can be explained by selective grazing. Modifications of the transition matrices are used to examine possible causes of the deviations.},

	abstract = {Ecological systems are generally considered among the most complex because they are characterized by a large number of diverse components, nonlinear interactions, scale multiplicity, and spatial heterogeneity. Hierarchy theory, as well as empirical evidence, suggests that complexity often takes the form of modularity in structure and functionality. Therefore, a hierarchical perspective can be essential to understanding complex ecological systems. But, how can such hierarchical approach help us with modeling spatially heterogeneous, nonlinear dynamic systems like landscapes, be they natural or human-dominated? In this paper, we present a spatially explicit hierarchical modeling approach to studying the patterns and processes of heterogeneous landscapes. We first discuss the theoretical basis for the modeling approach--the hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) paradigm and the scaling ladder strategy, and then describe the general structure of a hierarchical urban landscape model (HPDM-PHX) which is developed using this modeling approach. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical patch dynamics modeling platform (HPD-MP), a software package that is designed to facilitate the development of spatial hierarchical models. We then illustrate the utility of HPD-MP through two examples: a hierarchical cellular automata model of land use change and a spatial multi-species population dynamics model.},

	abstract = {Although oceanic dispersal in larval and juvenile marine animals is widely studied, the relative contributions of swimming behavior and ocean currents to movements and distribution are poorly understood [ 1–4 ]. The sea turtle “lost years” [ 5 ] (often referred to as the surface-pelagic [ 6 ] or oceanic [ 7 ] stage) are a classic example. Upon hatching, young turtles migrate offshore and are rarely observed until they return to coastal waters as larger juveniles [ 5 ]. Sightings of small turtles downcurrent of nesting beaches and in association with drifting organisms (e.g., Sargassum algae) led to this stage being described as a “passive migration” during which turtles’ movements are dictated by ocean currents [ 5–10 ]. However, laboratory and modeling studies suggest that dispersal trajectories might also be shaped by oriented swimming [ 11–15 ]. Here, we use an experimental approach designed to directly test the passive-migration hypothesis by deploying pairs of surface drifters alongside small green (Chelonia mydas) and Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) wild-caught turtles, tracking their movements via satellite telemetry. We conclusively demonstrate that these turtles do not behave as passive drifters. In nearly all cases, drifter trajectories were uncharacteristic of turtle trajectories. Species-specific and location-dependent oriented swimming behavior, inferred by subtracting track velocity from modeled ocean velocity, contributed substantially to individual movement and distribution. These findings highlight the importance of in situ observations for depicting the dispersal of weakly swimming animals. Such observations, paired with information on the mechanisms of orientation, will likely allow for more accurate predictions of the ecological and evolutionary processes shaped by animal movement.},

The field has grown rapidly over the past 15 years. The persistent influence of land-use history and natural disturbance on contemporary ecosystems has become apparent. Development of pattern metrics has largely stabilized, and they are widely used to relate landscape pattern to ecological responses. Analyses conducted at multiple scales have demonstrated the importance of landscape pattern for many taxa, and spatially mediated interspecific interactions are receiving increased attention. Disturbance remains prominent in landscape studies, and current research is addressing disturbance interactions. Integration of ecosystem and landscape ecology remains challenging but should enhance understanding of landscape function. Landscape ecology should continue to refine knowledge of when spatial heterogeneity is fundamentally important, rigorously test the generality of its concepts, and develop a more mechanistic understanding of the relationships between pattern and process.},

	url = {file:///Users/rlent/test/PDF/Wilson_2010-1830102528/Wilson_2010.pdf},
	abstract = {Temperature increases because of climate change are expected to cause expansions at the high latitude margins of species distributions, but, in practice, fragmented landscapes act as barriers to colonization for most species. Understanding how species distributions will shift in response to climate change therefore requires techniques that incorporate the combined effects of climate and landscape-scale habitat availability on colonization rates. We use a metapopulation model (Incidence Function Model, IFM) to test effects of fine-scale habitat use on patterns and rates of range expansion by the butterfly Hesperia comma. At its northern range margin in Britain, this species has increased its breadth of microhabitat use because of climate warming, leading to increased colonization rates. We validated the IFM by reconstructing expansions in five habitat networks between 1982 and 2000, before using it to predict metapopulation dynamics over 100 yr, for three scenarios based on observed changes to habitat use. We define the scenarios as "cold-world" (only hot, south-facing 1502013250? hillsides are deemed warm enough), "warm-world" in which 1002013300? hillsides can be populated, and "hot-world", where the background climate is warm enough to enable use of all aspects (as increasingly observed). In the simulations, increased habitat availability in the hot-world scenario led to faster range expansion rates, and to long-term differences in distribution size and pattern. Thus, fine-scale changes in the distribution of suitable microclimates led to landscape-scale changes in population size and colonization rate, resulting in coarse-scale changes to the species distribution. Despite use of a wider range of habitats associated with climate change, H. comma is still expected to occupy a small fraction of available habitat in 100 yr. The research shows that metapopulation models represent a potential framework to identify barriers to range expansion, and to predict the effects of environmental change or conservation interventions on species distributions and persistence.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Due to an overlap in the resources used by the flight muscles with the resources used during egg production, it has been hypothesised that an increased dispersal in fragmented landscapes may result in a physiological trade-off between flight and reproduction. In a common garden experiment, we investigated the effects of increased flight on the reproductive output of female speckled wood butterflies (Pararge aegeria, L.) from closed continuous woodland populations versus open highly fragmented agricultural landscapes in central France. Our flight treatment significantly affected resource allocation to egg size, but had no effect on mean daily fecundity. This treatment effect was similar for females from the two landscapes of origin, and suggests that energetic costs associated with increased flight result in a decrease in resource allocation to egg provisioning. There was a landscape-specific effect of flight on longevity: flight reduced longevity by 21\% in woodland females, but had no affect on agricultural females. This result suggests that woodland landscape females further compensate for excessive flight by redirecting resources away from somatic maintenance, resulting in reduced life spans. Our results strongly indicate that increased flight caused by changes in landscape structure may impact on key life history traits such as reproductive success and longevity.},

	abstract = {Some eyespots are thought to deflect attack away from the vulnerable body, yet there is limited empirical evidence for this function and its adaptive advantage. Here, we demonstrate the conspicuous ventral hindwing eyespots found on Bicyclus anynana butterflies protect against invertebrate predators, specifically praying mantids. Wet season (WS) butterflies with larger, brighter eyespots were easier for mantids to detect, but more difficult to capture compared to dry season (DS) butterflies with small, dull eyespots. Mantids attacked the wing eyespots of WS butterflies more frequently resulting in greater butterfly survival and reproductive success. With a reciprocal eyespot transplant, we demonstrated the fitness benefits of eyespots were independent of butterfly behaviour. Regardless of whether the butterfly was WS or DS, large marginal eyespots pasted on the hindwings increased butterfly survival and successful oviposition during predation encounters. In previous studies, DS B. anynana experienced delayed detection by vertebrate predators, but both forms suffered low survival once detected. Our results suggest predator abundance, identity and phenology may all be important selective forces for B. anynana. Thus, reciprocal selection between invertebrate and vertebrate predators across seasons may contribute to the evolution of the B. anynana polyphenism.},

	abstract = {High resolution remote sensing data facilitate the use of small-scale habitat features such as trees or hedges in the analysis of species-habitat relationships. Such data potentially enable more accurate species-habitat mapping than lower resolution data. Here, for the first time, we systematically investigated this hypothesis by altering the spatial resolution from 1�m up to 1000�m grain size in species-habitat models of 13 bird species. The study area covered the Nidda river catchment in central Germany, a large heterogeneous landscape of 1620�km2. A high resolution habitat map of the area was converted to coarser spatial and thematic resolutions in seven steps. We investigated how model performance responded to grain size, and we compared the differential effects of spatial resolution and thematic resolution on model performance. Explained deviance (D2) of the bird models generally decreased with coarser spatial resolution of the data, although it did not decrease monotonically in all species. On average across all species, model D2 decreased from 41.5 at 1�m grain size to 15.9 at 1000�m grain size. Ten species were best modelled at 1�m, two species at 3�m and one species at 32�m grain size. Model performance degraded continuously with increasing grain size, both in habitat generalist and habitat specialist bird species, and was systematically lower in habitat generalists. The higher model performance observed at finer grain sizes was most likely caused by the combination of three factors: (1) high spatial accuracy of bird records and (2) a more precise location and delineation of habitat features and, (3) to a lesser degree, by more habitat types differentiated in maps of finer resolution. We conclude that higher spatial and thematic resolution data can be essential for deriving accurate predictions on bird distribution patterns from species-habitat models. Especially for bird species that are sensitive to specific land-use types or to small-scaled habitat features, a grain size of 1-3�m seems most promising.},

	abstract = {1. We use an individual-based model describing the life of a monarch butterfly, which utilises milkweeds both aggregated in patches and scattered across the wider landscape as a substrate for laying eggs. The model simplifies the metapopulation of milkweed habitat patches by representing them as a proportion of the overall landscape, with the rest of the landscape considered matrix, which may contain some low density of milkweed plants. 2. The model simulates the number of eggs laid daily by a butterfly as it searches for hosts. The likelihood of finding hosts is related to the density of plants and the search ability of the butterfly. For an empty matrix, remaining in a habitat patch results in more eggs laid. However individuals that are good searchers have almost equivalent success without remaining in a habitat patch. These individuals are most affected by the presence of hosts in the matrix. 3. Given realistic values of habitat patch availability, our model shows that the presence of plants at a low density in the matrix has a substantial impact on the number of eggs laid; removing these plants can reduce lifetime potential fecundity by ca. 20\%. These results have implications for monarch butterflies inhabiting agricultural landscapes, in which genetically modified soybean that is resistant to herbicides has resulted in the decimation of milkweeds over large areas.},

	volume = {37},
	abstract = {Thirty-one populations of C. tullia from the British Isles [UK] (914 males and 540 females) have been scored for six forewing and eight hindwing spots, on all wings and surfaces, as well as for wing expanse and wing damage. Multivariate statistical techniques have been used to compare the populations simultaneously on all spot variables and population summary counts have been related to latitude, altitude and climatic gradients. Females exceed males in spotting and wing expanse but geographical patterns are similar for both sexes. Multivariate analyses of population data reveal a distinct clinal trend corresponding to the dramatic decrease in spotting north into Scotland. Thus, much of the variation in spotting can be represented by a single vector (cf. Figs 8,9). Traditional subspecies units (subsp. 'davus', 'polydama', 'scotica') can be separated as non-overlapping envelopes in the multivariate space on spotting, but inter-population variability is extensive, especially for the southernmost groups, 'polydama' and 'davus'. Only 'scotica' consistently emerges as a distinctive and compact group of populations in all analyses. Spotting in populations decreases significantly with latitude and altitude. This association is interpreted as an influence through climate, particularly through flight season sunshine levels and temperatures which are highly correlated with spotting (rs {\textgreater} 0.79 and {\textgreater} 0.65, respectively; see Fig. 10). Altogether, climate can account for 71-86\% of the interpopulation variability in spotting. It is argued that levels of spotting in C. tullia populations are mainly the outcome of opposing selection pressures for crypsis on the one hand and for deflecting attacks on the other, which respectively are determined by levels of activity and, thus ultimately, by ambient conditions. In the limited sunshine and reduced temperatures at the Scottish end of the cline, where C. tullia is less active and more vulnerable to predation, selection has been for crypsis against the vegetation substrate and thus for lowering spotting. In the sunnier, warmer conditions at the southern end of the cline, where C. tullia is more active and can effectively escape predator strikes, selection has been for large and numerous spots which act as decoys. Data on environmental conditions, behaviour, predators and wing damage concur with this hypothesis. Current phenetic relationships between populations on spotting are briefly reviewed against a background of Devensian glaciation and the development of climax vegetation in the present Flandrian interglacial.},

One reason for the belated adoption of informatics approaches in ecology is the breadth of ecologically pertinent data (from genes to the biosphere) and its highly heterogeneous nature. The variety of formats, logical structures, and sampling methods in ecology create significant challenges. Cultural barriers further impede progress, especially for the creation and adoption of data standards. Here we describe informatics frameworks for ecology, from subject-specific data warehouses, to generic data collections that use detailed metadata descriptions and formal ontologies to catalog and cross-reference information. Combining these approaches with automated data integration techniques and scientific workflow systems will maximize the value of data and open new frontiers for research in ecology.},

	abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

Here we report results from a large-scale, long-term experiment examining the effects of local population extinction for the dynamics of surrounding populations. From 2001-2008 we removed all adult butterflies from two large, neighboring populations within a system of 17 subpopulations of the Rocky Mountain Apollo butterfly, Parnassius smintheus. Surrounding populations were monitored using individual, mark-recapture methods. We found that population removal decreased immigration to surrounding populations in proportion to their connectivity to the removed populations. Correspondingly, within-generation population abundance declined. Despite these effects, we saw little consistent impact between generations. The extinction rates of surrounding populations were unaffected and local population growth was not consistently reduced by the lack of immigration. The broader results show that immigration affects local abundance within generations, but dynamics are mediated by density-dependence within populations and by broader density-independent factors acting between generations. The loss of immigrants resulting from extinction has little impact on the persistence of local populations in this system.},

Although many agent-based models are used strictly in a simulation context, statistical implementations are less common. To characterize complex dynamic processes, such as the spread of epidemics, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for formal statistical agent-based modeling using spatiotemporal binary data.

	abstract = {Describing the evolutionary dynamics of now extinct populations is challenging, as their genetic composition before extinction is generally unknown. The Glanville fritillary butterfly has a large extant metapopulation in the Åland Islands in Finland, but declined to extinction in the nearby fragmented southwestern (SW) Finnish archipelago in the 20th century. We genotyped museum samples for 222 SNPs across the genome, including SNPs from candidate genes and neutral regions. SW Finnish populations had significantly reduced genetic diversity before extinction, and their allele frequencies gradually diverged from those in contemporary Åland populations over 80 y. We identified 15 outlier loci among candidate SNPs, mostly related to flight, in which allele frequencies have changed more than the neutral expectation. At outlier loci, allele frequencies in SW Finland shifted in the same direction as newly established populations deviated from old local populations in contemporary Åland. Moreover, outlier allele frequencies in SW Finland resemble those in fragmented landscapes as opposed to continuous landscapes in the Baltic region. These results indicate selection for genotypes associated with good colonization capacity in the highly fragmented landscape before the extinction of the populations. Evolutionary response to habitat fragmentation may have enhanced the viability of the populations, but it did not save the species from regional extinction in the face of severe habitat loss and fragmentation. These results highlight a potentially common situation in changing environments: evolutionary changes are not strong enough to fully compensate for the direct adverse effects of environmental change and thereby rescue populations from extinction.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Long-distance seed dispersal is difficult to measure, yet key to understanding plant population dynamics and community composition. 2. We used a spatially explicit model to predict the distribution of seeds dispersed long distances by birds into habitat patches of different shapes. All patches were the same type of habitat and size, but varied in shape. They occurred in eight experimental landscapes, each with five patches of four different shapes, 150 m apart in a matrix of mature forest. The model was parameterized with small-scale movement data collected from field observations of birds. In a previous study we validated the model by testing its predictions against observed patterns of seed dispersal in real landscapes with the same types and spatial configuration of patches as in the model. 3. Here we apply the model more broadly, examining how patch shape influences the probability of seed deposition by birds into patches, how dispersal kernels (distributions of dispersal distances) vary with patch shape and starting location, and how movement of seeds between patches is affected by patch shape. 4. The model predicts that patches with corridors or other narrow extensions receive higher numbers of seeds than patches without corridors or extensions. This pattern is explained by edge-following behaviour of birds. Dispersal distances are generally shorter in heterogeneous landscapes (containing patchy habitat) than in homogeneous landscapes, suggesting that patches divert the movement of seed dispersers, â€˜holdingâ€™ them long enough to increase the probability of seed defecation in the patches. Dispersal kernels for seeds in homogeneous landscapes were smooth, whereas those in heterogenous landscapes were irregular. In both cases, long-distance ({\textgreater} 150 m) dispersal was surprisingly common, usually comprising approximately 50\% of all dispersal events. 5. Synthesis. Landscape heterogeneity has a large influence on patterns of long-distance seed dispersal. Our results suggest that long-distance dispersal events can be predicted using spatially explicit modelling to scale-up local movements, placing them in a landscape context. Similar techniques are commonly used by landscape ecologists to model other types of movement; they offer much promise to the study of seed dispersal.},

They can be thought of as a domesticated form of computer virus that lives in, and adapts to, a controlled environment. Digital organisms provide a unique opportunity with which to study evolutionary biology in a form of life that shares no ancestry with carbon-based life forms, and hence to distinguish general principles of evolution from historical accidents that are particular to biochemical life. In terms of the complexity of their evolutionary dynamics, digital organisms can be compared with biochemical viruses and bacteria. Recent studies of digital organisms have addressed long-term evolutionary adaptation and the growth of complexity in evolving systems, patterns of epistatic interactions in various genetic backgrounds, and quasi-species dynamics.},

	abstract = {How variation and variability (the capacity to vary) may respond to selection remain open questions. Indeed, effects of different selection regimes on variational properties, such as canalization and developmental stability are under debate. We analyzed the patterns of among- and within-individual variation in two wing-shape characters in populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained under fluctuating, disruptive, and stabilizing selection for more than 20 generations. Patterns of variation in wing size, which was not a direct target of selection, were also analyzed. Disruptive selection dramatically increased phenotypic variation in the two shape characters, but left phenotypic variation in wing size unaltered. Fluctuating and stabilizing selection consistently decreased phenotypic variation in all traits. In contrast, within-individual variation, measured by the level of fluctuating asymmetry, increased for all traits under all selection regimes. These results suggest that canalization and developmental stability are evolvable and presumably controlled by different underlying genetic mechanisms, but the evolutionary responses are not consistent with an adaptive response to selection on variation. Selection also affected patterns of directional asymmetry, although inconsistently across traits and treatments.},

	abstract = {Aim: Models relating species distributions to climate or habitat are widely used to predict the effects of global change on biodiversity. Most such approaches assume that climate governs coarse-scale species ranges, whereas habitat limits fine-scale distributions. We tested the influence of topoclimate and land cover on butterfly distributions and abundance in a mountain range, where climate may vary as markedly at a fine scale as land cover.Location: Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain, southern Europe)Methods: We sampled the butterfly fauna of 180 locations (89 in 2004, 91 in 2005) in a 10,800km2 region, and derived generalized linear models (GLMs) for species occurrence and abundance based on topoclimatic (elevation and insolation) or habitat (land cover, geology and hydrology) variables sampled at 100-m resolution using GIS. Models for each year were tested against independent data from the alternate year, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (distribution) or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) (abundance).Results: In independent model tests, 74\% of occurrence models achieved AUCs of {\textgreater} 0.7, and 85\% of abundance models were significantly related to observed abundance. Topoclimatic models outperformed models based purely on land cover in 72\% of occurrence models and 66\% of abundance models. Including both types of variables often explained most variation in model calibration, but did not significantly improve model cross-validation relative to topoclimatic models. Hierarchical partitioning analysis confirmed the overriding effect of topoclimatic factors on species distributions, with the exception of several species for which the importance of land cover was confirmed.Main conclusions: Topoclimatic factors may dominate fine-resolution species distributions in mountain ranges where climate conditions vary markedly over short distances and large areas of natural habitat remain. Climate change is likely to be a key driver of species distributions in such systems and could have important effects on biodiversity. However, continued habitat protection may be vital to facilitate range shifts in response to climate change.},

	abstract = {Most evolutionary theory does not deal with populations expanding or
contracting in space. Invasive species, climate change, epidemics, and the breakdown of
dispersal barriers, however, all create populations in this kind of spatial disequilibrium.
Importantly, spatial disequilibrium can have important ecological and evolutionary outcomes.
During continuous range expansion, for example, populations on the expanding front
experience novel evolutionary pressures because frontal populations are assorted by dispersal
ability and have a lower density of conspecifics than do core populations. These conditions
favor the evolution of traits that increase rates of dispersal and reproduction. Additionally,
lowered density on the expanding front eventually frees populations on the expanding edge
from specialist, coevolved enemies, permitting higher investment into traits associated with
dispersal and reproduction rather than defense against pathogens. As a result, the process of
range expansion drives rapid life-history evolution, and this seems to occur despite ongoing
serial founder events that have complex effects on genetic diversity at the expanding front.
Traits evolving on the expanding edge are smeared across the landscape as the front moves
through, leaving an ephemeral signature of range expansion in the life-history traits of a
species across its newly colonized range. Recent studies suggest that such nonequilibrium
processes during recent population history may have contributed to many patterns usually
ascribed to evolutionary forces acting in populations at spatial equilibrium.},

	abstract = {This book provides a modern, synthetic overview of interactions between insects and their environments from a physiological perspective that integrates information across a range of approaches and scales. It shows that evolved physiological responses at the individual level are translated into coherent physiological and ecological patterns at larger, even global scales. This is done by examining in detail the ways in which insects obtain resources from the environment, process these resources in various ways, and turn the results into energy which allows them to regulate their internal environment as well as cope with environmental extremes of temperature and water availability. The book demonstrates that physiological responses are not only characterized by substantial temporal variation, but also show coherent variation across several spatial scales. At the largest, global scale, there appears to be substantial variation associated with the hemisphere in which insects are found. Such variation has profound implications for patterns of biodiversity as well as responses to climate change, and these implications are explicitly discussed. The book provides a novel integration of the understanding gained from broad-scale field studies of many species and the more narrowly focused laboratory investigations of model organisms. In so doing, it reflects the growing realization that an integration of mechanistic and large-scale comparative physiology can result in unexpected insights into the diversity of insects.},

	abstract = {The geographic range of a species is influenced by past phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns. However, other historical interactions, including the interplay between life history and geography, are also likely involved. Therefore, the range size of a species can be explained on the basis of niche-breadth or dispersal related hypotheses, and previous work on European butterflies suggests that both, under the respective guise of ecological specialisation and colonising ability may apply. In the present study, data from 205 species of butterflies from the Iberian peninsula were processed through multiple regression analyses to test for correlations between geographic range size, life history traits and geographic features of the species distribution types. In addition, the percentage of variance explained by the subsets of variables analyzed in the study, with and without control for phylogenetic effects was tested. Despite a complex pattern of bivariate correlations, we found that larval polyphagy was the single best correlate of range size, followed by dispersal. Models that combined both life history traits and geographic characteristics performed better than models generated independently. The combined variables explained at least 39\% of the variance. Bivariate correlations between range size and body size, migratory habits or egg size primarily reflected taxonomic patterning and reciprocal correlations with larval diet breadth and adult phenology. Therefore, aspects of niche breadth i.e. potential larval diet breadth emerged as the most influential determinants of range size. However, the relationships between these types of ecological traits and biogeographic history must still be considered when associations between life history and range size are of interest.},

However, existing pathway models do not generally explain the dynamic regulation of anatomical shape due to the difficulty of inferring and testing non-linear regulatory networks responsible for appropriate form, shape, and pattern. We present a method that automates the discovery and testing of regulatory networks explaining morphological outcomes directly from the resultant phenotypes, producing network models as testable hypotheses explaining regeneration data. Our system integrates a formalization of the published results in planarian regeneration, an in silico simulator in which the patterning properties of regulatory networks can be quantitatively tested in a regeneration assay, and a machine learning module that evolves networks whose behavior in this assay optimally matches the database of planarian results. We applied our method to explain the key experiments in planarian regeneration, and discovered the first comprehensive model of anterior-posterior patterning in planaria under surgical, pharmacological, and genetic manipulations. Beyond the planarian data, our approach is readily generalizable to facilitate the discovery of testable regulatory networks in developmental biology and biomedicine, and represents the first developmental model discovered de novo from morphological outcomes by an automated system.},

	abstract = {Aim: This study investigated the influence of contemporary habitat loss on the genetic diversity and structure of animal species using a common, but ecologically specialized, butterfly, Theclinesthes albocincta (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), as a model.Location: South Australia. Methods: We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and allozyme datasets to investigate the genetic structure and genetic diversity among populations of T. albocincta in a fragmented landscape and compared this diversity and structure with that of populations in two nearby landscapes that have more continuous distributions of butterflies and their habitat. Butterflies were sampled from 15 sites and genotyped, first using 363 informative AFLP bands and then using 17 polymorphic allozyme loci (n = 248 and 254, respectively). We complemented these analyses with phylogeographic information based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype information derived from a previous study in the same landscapes. Results: Both datasets indicated a relatively high level of genetic structuring across the sampling range (AFLP, FST = 0.34; allozyme, FST = 0.13): structure was greatest among populations in the fragmented landscape (AFLP, FST = 0.15; allozyme, FST = 0.13). Populations in the fragmented landscape also had significantly lower genetic diversity than populations in the other two landscapes: there were no detectable differences in genetic diversity between the two continuous landscapes. There was also evidence (r2 = 0.33) of an isolation by distance effect across the sampled range of the species. Main conclusions: The multiple lines of evidence, presented within a phylogeographic context, support the hypothesis that contemporary habitat fragmentation has been a major driver of genetic erosion and differentiation in this species. Theclinesthes albocincta populations in the fragmented landscape are thus likely to be at greater risk of extinction because of reduced genetic diversity, their isolation from conspecific subpopulations in other landscapes, and other extrinsic forces acting on their small population sizes. Our study provides compelling evidence that habitat loss and fragmentation have significant rapid impacts on the genetic diversity and structure of butterfly populations, especially specialist species with particular habitat preferences and poor dispersal abilities.},

	abstract = {1) This paper is the second in a series of three which describe experimental studies of mimicry in some North American butterflies. 2) Seven caged Florida Scrub Jays (Cyanocitta coerulescens coerulescens) were used as predators in feeding experiments designed to test the effectiveness of mimicry in the butterflies Battus philenor (model) and the presumed mimics, Papilio troilus, P. polyxenes, and the black female form of P. glaucus. The butter-flies were immobilized and their wings were folded together dorsally, so that only mimicry in the characters of the underside of the wings was being tested. 3) The three experimental birds ate all the non-mimetic butterflies, which were offered in couplet with each model or mimic presented. Because the mimics proved to be completely palatable to the control birds, these birds were not offered the edible, non-mimetic butterflies in the present experiments. 4) The model B. philenor was unpalatable to all three experimental birds. 5) After successive trials with the model, the mimic, P. troilus, was offered to the experimental birds in place of the model. Two of the three experimental birds did not discriminate P. troilus from B. philenor. The third experimental bird ate P. troilus. However, this bird then lost its ability to reject B. philenor on sight alone, which indicated that discrimination by sight was not effective between the mimic and model. 6) When P. polyxenes was given, it was not discriminated from the model, B. philenor, by the same two experimental birds which had failed to recognize P. troilus as different from B. philenor. The third experimental bird apparently did discriminate P. polyxenes from B. philenor. 7) When the black female form of P. glaucus was given in place of the model, it was apparently discriminated by two of the three experimental birds. The third bird, in this case, did not discriminate P. glaucus from B. philenor. 8) The same characteristic behavior that had been shown by the experimental birds toward the Monarch and the Viceroy was again evident when B. philenor and its mimics were presented. 9) The four control birds, which never were given the model, found P. troilus, P. polyxenes, and the black female form of P. glaucus palatable; the mean time which each control bird took to seize P. troilus also indicated that it was particularly palatable. 10) A comparison of the reaction of the experimental and control birds to P. troilus, and a comparison of their reaction to P. polyxenes, both gave values for P of less than .001. The significant difference in response in each case is attributed to the fact that the experimental birds had experience with models before receiving the mimics. The unpalatability of B. philenor was associated with its color pattern; the birds then could not discriminate or confused the color pattern of the mimics with that of the model. Under the conditions of the experiment, the effectiveness of mimicry in P. troilus and P. polyxenes has been demonstrated, and both have been shown to be Batesian mimics. 11) A comparison of the reaction of the experimental and control birds to the black female form of P. glaucus, on the basis of a small number of trials, showed no significant difference between the two sets of birds in their treatment of this butterfly, but the possibility of the mimicry of B. philenor by P. glaucus was clearly suggested by the experiments. Explanations of the discrimination of P. glaucus from B. philenor by two of the three experimental birds have been given.},

	abstract = {The scarce heath (Coenonympha hero) is an internationally threatened butterfly in Western Europe, where it occurs primarily on hay fields and abandoned arable land in a small-scale agricultural landscape of south-central Scandinavia. Due to afforestation, this habitat is becoming increasingly fragmented in Sweden, and it can be expected that the scarce heath will decline abruptly when threshold conditions for metapopulation persistence are no longer met. We used stepwise polychotomous logistic regression to compare habitat characteristics and isolation measures for patches that harbour large, small or no populations, respectively, in an area of south-western Sweden. We found that patch area, distance to the nearest large population and amount of Galium spp. explained a significant part of the variation in relative abundance among patches. Distance to nearest large population resulted in a better model to predict occupancy than both distance to the nearest inhabited patch and connectivity, which suggests that primarily large populations act as sources for small satellite populations. Today, sites of three of the eight larger populations in the study area have been planted with spruce or pine and will disappear within 20 years. We argue that the disappearance of these patches may very well lead to rapid extinction of the whole metapopulation system.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We studied the historical biogeography of a group of butterflies in the Holarctic region belonging to the genus Coenonympha (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae: Coenonymphina), based on a phylogenetic hypothesis estimated from three genes. The genus is distributed mainly in the Palaearctic region, with two species extending into the Nearctic region. The tree is generally well supported and shows that Coenonympha is paraphyletic with respect to Lyela (syn.n.) and Triphysa (syn.n.), and we hence synonymize the latter two with Coenonympha. Within Coenonympha we identify three species groups, the tullia, glycerion and hero groups. The North American tullia exemplars are not sister to the Eurasian ones. A diva analysis indicates that the ancestor of the group was present in the Central Palaearctic or Central Palaeartic + Western Palaearctic or Central Palaearctic + Eastern Palaearctic. We conclude that the most likely origin of extant members of Coenonympha was in the Central Asian mountains. The tullia and hero groups started diverging in Europe following dispersal into the region. There have been two independent colonizations into Africa. The drying up of the Mediterranean during the Messinian period probably played an important role, allowing colonization into the Mediterranean islands and Africa.},

Location  The Trans-Volcanic Belt (TVB) of central Mexico, including the states of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Veracruz.

Methods  We sequenced the cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA gene for 281 individuals from 26 populations and nine mountain ranges in the TVB, and used Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction and Markov chain Monte Carlo coalescent methods to infer historical demographic parameters and divergences among populations in each mountain system.

Results  We found deep genetic divergences between eastern and central TVB mountain systems despite their recent volcanic origin. Populations of P. leprosa show a pattern of refugial populations in the north-eastern and eastern limits of the species’ distribution, and genetic evidence of rapid population expansion in mountain ranges of the central TVB. The oldest divergences among populations date to c. 3.8 Ma, and the most recent divergences in the central TVB are Pleistocene in age (c. 0.7 Ma).

Main conclusions  Given the timing and order of population diversification in P. leprosa, we conclude that early isolation in multiple habitat refuges in north-eastern and eastern mountain ranges played an important role in structuring population diversity in the TVB, followed by population expansion and genetic divergence of the central range populations. The dynamic climatic and volcanic changes in this landscape generally coincide with the history of intra-specific diversification in P. leprosa. Climate-driven changes in habitat distribution in an actively changing volcanic landscape have shaped divergences in the TVB and very likely contributed to the high levels of speciation and endemism in this biodiverse region.},

	abstract = {We review evidence for climate change over the past several millennia from instrumental and high-resolution climate “proxy” data sources and climate modeling studies. We focus on changes over the past 1 to 2 millennia. We assess reconstructions and modeling studies analyzing a number of different climate fields, including atmospheric circulation diagnostics, precipitation, and drought. We devote particular attention to proxy-based reconstructions of temperature patterns in past centuries, which place recent large-scale warming in an appropriate longer-term context. Our assessment affirms the conclusion that late 20th century warmth is unprecedented at hemispheric and, likely, global scales. There is more tentative evidence that particular modes of climate variability, such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, may have exhibited late 20th century behavior that is anomalous in a long-term context. Regional conclusions, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and parts of the tropics where high-resolution proxy data are sparse, are more circumspect. The dramatic differences between regional and hemispheric/global past trends, and the distinction between changes in surface temperature and precipitation/drought fields, underscore the limited utility in the use of terms such as the “Little Ice Age” and “Medieval Warm Period” for describing past climate epochs during the last millennium. Comparison of empirical evidence with proxy-based reconstructions demonstrates that natural factors appear to explain relatively well the major surface temperature changes of the past millennium through the 19th century (including hemispheric means and some spatial patterns). Only anthropogenic forcing of climate, however, can explain the recent anomalous warming in the late 20th century.},

This book not only explores how butterflies adapt to climatic gradients and weather patterns, but also shows how their biogeography and evolution have responded to climate change in the past, and how they are likely to respond in the future as the enhanced greenhouse effect increasingly alters the world's climate. Roger Dennis begins by explaining the atmospheric systems in which butterflies live and which impose constraints upon their activity, development and function. He examines how butterflies thermoregulate, despite having very little capacity for generating their own heat. He then covers butterflies' life history strategies, their adaptations to seasonality and their tolerance of extreme conditions. The discussion takes him into the controversial areas of population dynamics and species diversity. He presents a new model to explain how gradients in adult butterfly morphology and colour patterns relate to gradients in climate. Finally, Dennis explores further adaptive responses to climatic change, using models to explain past events and to predict the impact on butterfly populations of global warming. "Butterflies and Climate Change" aims to contribute not only to insect ecology, but also to our understanding of how anthropogenic climate change affects natural populations and ecosystems. The book is designed to be readable and accessible to the non-specialist, but fully referenced and with a detailed bibliography.},

The butterflies were immobilized and their wings were folded together dorsally, so that only mimicry in the characters of the underside of the wings was being tested in these experiments. 3) The present experiments tested mimicry in the classic example of the Monarch (Danaus plexippus) and Viceroy (Limenitis archippus archippus). 4) The results of these experiments show that the non-mimetic butterflies, used in couplet with each model or mimic, were eaten in every trial by all birds. 5) The four experimental birds were given numerous trials with the model, the Monarch. The Monarch was not eaten by these birds in any trial, and in many trials was not touched, after initial learning had taken place. 6) After the experimental birds had been given more than 50 trials with the Monarch, the Viceroy was substituted for the Monarch at intervals. The Viceroy was never eaten by the four experimental birds, and in many trials was not even touched. 7) Characteristic behavior shown by the four experimental birds after the presentation of both Monarchs and Viceroys indicated no discrimination between the two species of butterflies. 8) The four control birds had no prior laboratory experience with the Monarch, and these birds ate the Viceroy in many trials. 9) A statistical analysis of the reaction to the Viceroy by the experimental and control birds indicated that the two groups did not react to the Viceroy in the same way. The difference in response is attributed to the prior laboratory experience of the experimental birds with the Monarch. The color pattern of the Viceroy was apparently associated with the complete inedibility and similar color pattern of the Monarch. Under the conditions of the experiment, mimicry has been shown to be effective. 10) The data indicate that the Viceroy is more edible than the Monarch, but less edible than the non-mimetic butterflies used in the experiments. In addition, the control birds took longer to seize Viceroys, on the average, than they took to seize the non-mimetic butterflies. Therefore the Viceroy is not termed either a Batesian or a Mullerian mimic in the classical sense. 11) Learning behavior and memory in the Scrub Jays were considered briefly. The records showed that three of the four experimental birds remembered to reject a Monarch and a Viceroy on sight alone, after a period of over two weeks had elapsed since their last experience with these butterflies.},

	abstract = {Eyespots are found in a variety of animals, in particular lepidopterans. The role of eyespots as antipredator mechanisms has been discussed since the 19th Century, with two main hypotheses invoked to explain their occurrence. The first is that large, centrally located eyespots intimidate predators by resembling the eyes of the predators' own enemies; the second, though not necessarily conflicting, hypothesis is that small, peripherally located eyespots function as markers to deflect the attacks of predators to non-vital regions of the body. A third possibility is also proposed; that eyespots intimidate predators merely because they are novel or rarely encountered salient features. These hypotheses are reviewed, with special reference given to avian predators, since these are likely to be the principal visually hunting predators of the lepidopterans considered. Also highlighted is the necessity to consider the potential influence of sexual selection on lepidopteran wing patterns, and the genetics and development of eyespot formation.},

The habitat is the basic unit for developments in life history, population dynamics, landscape ecology and conservation of organisms. It is frequently treated as a particulate, invariant and homogeneous entity (a patch). Here we examine the implications of using this concept of habitat in butterfly biology. In doing so, we suggest the alternative approach of applying a functional resource-based concept of habitat. This recognises the fundamental requirements of organisms, consumables and utilities, the latter describing suitable environmental conditions as well as essential substrates. We argue that a resource-based concept is critical for butterfly conservation and call for the development of a resource database on butterfly biology .},

	abstract = {Variation of eye-spots in the wing pattern of Coenonympha pamphilus (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied in the Urals with adjacent territories and in Dzhelal-Abad Province of Kyrgyzstan. Discriminant analysis of the wing length and eye-spot diameter and the phenetic distances calculated by the Hartman’s method revealed clinal variation of the characters. The butterflies in the northern parts of the range (Sverdlovsk and Kurgan Provinces) are smaller than those in the south (Orenburg and Chelyabinsk Provinces) and have fewer eye-spots which themselves are smaller. The Kyrgyzstan specimens differ significantly from the Ural ones (the nominotypical subspecies) in both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the wing pattern, and should probably be assigned to the subspecies C. pamphilus marginata Heyne, 1894. As in most Satyridae, females of C. pamphilus are larger than males and on the average possess more eye-spots on the wings. The degree of phenotypic variation in natural populations was studied using the method of variation spectra (Kovalenko, 1996a, 1996b, 2007, etc.). The arrangement of phenotypic combinations within the theoretical spectrum (St) matrix allows one to describe the actual (Sr) and potential (Sp) spectra for either sex and for the species as a whole. The actual spectrum was found to be considerably broader in males than in females. With minor variations, Sr and Sp showed the same general trends in different samples of both sexes. In all the samples, phenetic combinations with one spot on the fore wing (in cell M  1-M  2) were predominant. The hind wing had either no spots (which was typical of males, especially in the northern parts of the range) or the maximum possible number, six (mostly in females, more often in the southern parts of the range). The phenetic combinations with the maximum (4) number of spots on the fore wing and the minimum number (0) on the hind wing are prohibited for C. pamphilus.},

Wildlife ecologists, however, often must take a more passive approach to investigating causality. Their observational studies lack one or more of the 3 cornerstones of experimentation: controls, randomization, and replication. Although an observational study can be analyzed similarly to an experiment, one is less certain that the presumed treatment actually caused the observed response. Because the investigator does not actively manipulate the system, the chance that something other than the treatment caused the observed results is increased. We reviewed observational studies and contrasted them with experiments and, to a lesser extent, sample surveys. We identified features that distinguish each method of learning and illustrate or discuss some complications that may arise when analyzing results of observational studies. Findings from observational studies are prone to bias. Investigators can reduce the chance of reaching erroneous conclusions by formulating a priori hypotheses that can be pursued multiple ways and by evaluating the sensitivity of study conclusions to biases of various magnitudes. In the end, however, professional judgment that considers all available evidence is necessary to render a decision regarding causality based on observational studies.},

Objective To determine the effects of cognitive training on daily function and durability of training on cognitive abilities. Design, Setting, and Participants Five-year follow-up of a randomized controlled single-blind trial with 4 treatment groups. A volunteer sample of 2832 persons (mean age, 73.6 years; 26\% black), living independently in 6 US cities, was recruited from senior housing, community centers, and hospitals and clinics. The study was conducted between April 1998 and December 2004. Five-year follow-up was completed in 67\% of the sample. Interventions Ten-session training for memory (verbal episodic memory), reasoning (inductive reasoning), or speed of processing (visual search and identification); 4-session booster training at 11 and 35 months after training in a random sample of those who completed training. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported and performance-based measures of daily function and cognitive abilities. Results The reasoning group reported significantly less difficulty in the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) than the control group (effect size, 0.29; 99\% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.55). Neither speed of processing training (effect size, 0.26; 99\% CI, -0.002 to 0.51) nor memory training (effect size, 0.20; 99\% CI, -0.06 to 0.46) had a significant effect on IADL. The booster training for the speed of processing group, but not for the other 2 groups, showed a significant effect on the performance-based functional measure of everyday speed of processing (effect size, 0.30; 99\% CI, 0.08-0.52). No booster effects were seen for any of the groups for everyday problem-solving or self-reported difficulty in IADL. Each intervention maintained effects on its specific targeted cognitive ability through 5 years (memory: effect size, 0.23 [99\% CI, 0.11-0.35]; reasoning: effect size, 0.26 [99\% CI, 0.17-0.35]; speed of processing: effect size, 0.76 [99\% CI, 0.62-0.90]). Booster training produced additional improvement with the reasoning intervention for reasoning performance (effect size, 0.28; 99\% CI, 0.12-0.43) and the speed of processing intervention for speed of processing performance (effect size, 0.85; 99\% CI, 0.61-1.09). Conclusions Reasoning training resulted in less functional decline in self-reported IADL. Compared with the control group, cognitive training resulted in improved cognitive abilities specific to the abilities trained that continued 5 years after the initiation of the intervention.

Range shifts have been detected in a number of European taxa for which long-term government-initiated or organized-survey data are available. In North America, well-organized long-term data needed to document such shifts are much less common. Opportunistic observations made by citizen scientist groups may be an excellent alternative to systematic surveys. From 1992 to 2010, 19,779 butterfly surveys were made by amateur naturalists in Massachusetts, a geographically small state located at the convergence of northern and southern bioclimatic zones in eastern North America. From these data, we estimated population trends for nearly all butterfly species (100 of 116 species present) using list-length analysis. Population trajectories indicate increases of many species near their northern range limits and declines in nearly all species (17 of 21) near their southern range limits. Certain life-history traits, especially overwintering stage, were strongly associated with declines. Our results suggest that a major, climate-induced shift of North American butterflies, characterized by northward expansions of warm-adapted and retreat of cold-adapted species, is underway.},

This paper identifies the potential changes in the future distribution of species under the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios, in order that such changes can be taken into account in conservation management. Location The model was applied to Britain and Ireland. Methods A model based on an artificial neural network was used to predict the changing bioclimate envelopes of species in Britain and Ireland. Fifty-four species representing 15 habitats were modelled. Results The modelled species could be placed into three categories: those losing suitable climate space, those gaining it, and those showing little or no change. When the species were associated with habitats it was found that Arctic-Alpine/montane heath communities were the most sensitive to climate change, followed by pine woodland and beech woodland in southern England. In lowland heath, wet heath, cereal field margins, coastal grazing marsh, drought-prone acid grassland and calcareous grassland, the species either showed little change or an increase in suitable climate space. The other eight habitats showed a mixed response. Conclusions The species show a variety of responses to climate change and thus their current habitat associations may alter. The uncertain future of some species and habitats is highlighted. Conservation policy and practice will need to be revised in the face of climate change.},

The review covers fitness consequences of variation in size, development time and growth rate, and effects of sex, photoperiod, temperature, diet, and perceived mortality risk on these traits. We give special attention to evidence for adaptive plasticity in growth rates because of the important effects of such plasticity on the expected relationships between development time and adult size and, hence, on the use of life-history, fitness, and optimality approaches in ecology, as well as in genetics.},

First, the procedure is flexible and does not force estimates of the surface to conform to a specific mathematical shape. The need for a flexible method is illustrated by an example using quadratic regression. Second, estimates of multidimensional surfaces can be visualized in two or three dimensions. This simplification is accomplished by making cross sections of the surface in the few most interesting directions. Finally, the method is designed to handle survival and other nonnormal fitness components. We apply the procedure to two data sets. In song sparrows, the survival surface is approximated by a ridge favoring an allometric relation between body mass and wing length. Survival in human infants rises steeply with increasing birth mass and maternal gestation period to a broad flat dome. Our results emphasize the ubiquity of "correlational" selection and illustrate how traits jointly determine fitness.},

	abstract = {In Butterflies: Ecology and Evolution Taking Flight, the world's leading experts synthesize current knowledge of butterflies to show how the study of these fascinating creatures as model systems can lead to deeper understanding of ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes in general. The twenty-six chapters are organized into broad functional areas, covering the uses of butterflies in the study of behavior, ecology, genetics and evolution, systematics, and conservation biology. Especially in the context of the current biodiversity crisis, this book shows how results found with butterflies can help us understand large, rapid changes in the world we share with them—for example, geographic distributions of some butterflies have begun to shift in response to global warming, giving early evidence of climate change that scientists, politicians, and citizens alike should heed.The first international synthesis of butterfly biology in two decades, Butterflies: Ecology and Evolution Taking Flight offers students, scientists, and amateur naturalists a concise overview of the latest developments in the field. Furthermore, it articulates an exciting new perspective of the whole group of approximately 15,000 species of butterflies as a comprehensive model system for all the sciences concerned with biodiversity and its preservation.

We analyzed to what extent fitness-related traits in the scarce heath ( Coenonympha hero), a butterfly, are affected by population size and isolation and whether differences in food quality influence these effects. We categorized nine populations as either large or small and isolated. Full-sib groups of offspring from 27 females were followed under seminatural conditions. Because of increased zygote mortality, egg hatchability was significantly lower in the small and isolated populations than in the large ones. Population category had no effect on larval weight under optimal conditions, but weight was significantly lower in the small-isolated category with low food quality. The effects of inbreeding can thus be hidden when conditions are benign but can appear under stress. Survival also differed significantly between population categories, and larval developmental time tended to be longer in the small-isolated category, irrespective of food conditions. We suggest that the differences in fitness between offspring from large and small isolated populations are at least partly due to inbreeding. This adds a further threat to a species that is already suffering from decreasing population sizes and increasing isolation among populations.},

How individuals within a population distribute themselves across resource patches of varying quality has been an important focus of ecological theory. The ideal free distribution predicts equal fitness amongst individuals in a 1 : 1 ratio with resources, whereas resource defence theory predicts different degrees of monopolization (fitness variance) as a function of temporal and spatial resource clumping and population density.



*
One overlooked landscape characteristic is the spatial distribution of resource patches, altering the equitability of resource accessibility and thereby the effective number of competitors. While much work has investigated the influence of morphology on competitive ability for different resource types, less is known regarding the phenotypic characteristics conferring relative ability for a single resource type, particularly when exploitative competition predominates.



*
Here we used young-of-the-year rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to test whether and how the spatial distribution of resource patches and population density interact to influence the level and variance of individual growth, as well as if functional morphology relates to competitive ability. Feeding trials were conducted within stream channels under three spatial distributions of nine resource patches (distributed, semi-clumped and clumped) at two density levels (9 and 27 individuals).



*
Average trial growth was greater in high-density treatments with no effect of resource distribution. Within-trial growth variance had opposite patterns across resource distributions. Here, variance decreased at low-population, but increased at high-population densities as patches became increasingly clumped as the result of changes in the levels of interference vs. exploitative competition. Within-trial growth was related to both pre- and post-trial morphology where competitive individuals were those with traits associated with swimming capacity and efficiency: larger heads/bodies/caudal fins and less angled pectoral fins.



*
The different degrees of within-population growth variance at the same density level found here, as a function of spatial resource distribution, provide an explanation for the inconsistencies in within-site growth variance and population regulation often noted with regard to density dependence in natural landscapes.},

	abstract = {1. Biotope and resources data are rarely attached to arthropod (butterfly) synoptic monitoring systems, and invariably not linked to behavioural exploitation of vegetation substrates. Yet, these data allow us to examine resource use within different biotopes and to distinguish more clearly between habitat and the matrix. 2. Comparative data on vegetation exploitation for different behaviours (search flight, direct flight, tactile inspections, perching, feeding, interactions, oviposition) were collected using transect sections over a range of biotopes from bare ground to mature woodland for two closely related satyrine butterflies, Maniola jurtina and Pyronia tithonus with overlapping flight times. Occupancy data were obtained on Pararge aegeria as a marker for the woodland end of the biotope spectrum. 3. There were clear distinctions in biotope occupancy between M. jurtina (grassland bias) and P. tithonus (shrub bias); significant differences in exploitation of vegetation substrates (except for nectar feeding) coincided with this bias in transect sections which comprise both grassland and shrubs. The exception (nectar feeding) is explained by the decline in shrub (Rubus fruticosus) nectar and increase in herb nectar during the later emergence of P. tithonus. 4. Direct flight increased in unsuitable biotopes for both species. However, resource-exploiting behaviour ({\textgreater}70\%) predominated even in biotopes that would be regarded as completely unsuitable for supporting the species and where less than 2\% of individuals for each species were observed. 5. Simultaneous collection of biotope, resources, and behavioural data is needed for monitoring affinities of butterflies to vegetation structures and using butter- flies as indicators of environmental changes. 6. Much of the landscape is shown to comprise valuable resources for butterflies, even when classified for metapopulation studies as empty matrix.},

A butterfly (Euphydryas editha) metapopulation contained patches of two types: undisturbed outcrops and logged clearings (where the insects' traditional host had been killed). Butterflies retained their traditional host in the outcrops, but in the clearings they used a novel host that was abundant in both patch types. We estimated the strength of natural selection on host use within and among these patch types. We also repeatedly measured spatial variation of oviposition preference, a heritable univariate trait. The causes of this variation were different at three scales. First, a genetic difference in preference between insects in an adjacent clearing and outcrop (200 m apart) was due principally to nonrandom gene flow. Insects actively assorted themselves between the patches according to their preference genotypes. Second, preferences in outcrop patches 1-4 km apart were significantly associated with their degree of isolation from clearings. Emigration from clearings had diluted local adaptation in outcrops. Finally, differences in preference between disturbed and undisturbed metapopulations 8.5 km apart were due to differences between them in natural selection. Within the disturbed metapopulation, the preference difference between a clearing and an adjacent outcrop remained constant over time even while massive temporal changes in mean preference occurred across both patches in response to fluctuating natural selection on host use. A frost in 1992 extinguished all the clearing populations, and use of the novel host ceased. However, preferences in an outcrop patch continued to differ from those in the undisturbed metapopulation with the same diet, a legacy of past gene flow from clearing to outcrop.},

	abstract = {Summary * 1Some species have expanded their ranges during recent climate warming and the availability of breeding habitat and species’ dispersal ability are two important factors determining expansions. The exploitation of a wide range of larval host plants should increase an herbivorous insect species’ ability to track climate by increasing habitat availability. Therefore we investigated whether the performance of a species on different host plants changed towards its range boundary, and under warmer temperatures. * 2We studied the polyphagous butterfly Polygonia c-album, which is currently expanding its range in Britain and apparently has altered its host plant preference from Humulus lupulus to include other hosts (particularly Ulmus glabra and Urtica dioica). We investigated insect performance (development time, larval growth rate, adult size, survival) and adult flight morphology on these host plants under four rearing temperatures (18-28·5 °C) in populations from core and range margin sites. * 3In general, differences between core and margin populations were small compared with effects of rearing temperature and host plant. In terms of insect performance, host plants were generally ranked U. glabra  U. dioica {\textgreater} H. lupulus at all temperatures. Adult P. c-album can either enter diapause or develop directly and higher temperatures resulted in more directly developing adults, but lower survival rates (particularly on the original host H. lupulus) and smaller adult size. * 4Adult flight morphology of wild-caught individuals from range margin populations appeared to be related to increased dispersal potential relative to core populations. However, there was no difference in laboratory reared individuals, and conflicting results were obtained for different measures of flight morphology in relation to larval host plant and temperature effects, making conclusions about dispersal potential difficult. * 5Current range expansion of P. c-album is associated with the exploitation of more widespread host plants on which performance is improved. This study demonstrates how polyphagy may enhance the ability of species to track climate change. Our findings suggest that observed differences in climate-driven range shifts of generalist vs. specialist species may increase in the future and are likely to lead to greatly altered community composition.},

	abstract = {The study of protected areas and climate change has now spanned two decades. Pioneering work in the late 1980s recognized the potential implications of shifting species range boundaries for static protected areas. Many early recommendations for protected area design were general, emphasizing larger protected areas, buffer zones, and connectivity between reserves. There were limited practical tests of these suggestions. Development of modeling and conservation planning methods in the 1990s allowed more rigorous testing of concepts of reserve and connectivity function in a changing climate. These studies have shown decreasing species representation in existing reserves due to climate change, and the ability of new protected areas to help slow loss of representation in mid-century scenarios. Connectivity on protected area periphery seems more effective than corridors linking protected areas. However, corridors serving other purposes, such as large carnivore movement, may be useful for accommodating species range shifts as well. Assisted migration and ex situ management strategies to complement protected areas are being explored. Finally, in scenarios of the latter half of the century, protected areas and connectivity become increasingly expensive and decreasingly effective, indicating the importance of reducing human-induced climate change.},

	abstract = {For threatened species that prove intractable to direct survey, there is a premium on being able to predict site occupancy using more readily available site data. Herein, we use geographical and ecological data for Coenonympha tullia from 148 sites surveyed in 1995-1996 to determine the probability of site occupancy in a further 33 sites surveyed in 1997. Discriminant function analysis using site-specific data on habitat quality and habitat area produces a 91\% correct classification of the 148 sites surveyed in 1995-1996 and a 79\% correct classification for the 33 surveyed in suitable conditions during 1997. Data on site isolation does not improve the classification of sites. The difference in classifications between the year groups is significant. It is caused by the unexpected (probability {\textless} 1\%) absence of the butterfly from three large, well-resourced sites at high altitude ({\textgreater} 400 m). The inference is that there is an altitudinal limit or effect (i.e. biennial emergence pattern) to C. tullia in England. These results suggest that occupancy of Eriophorum-Erica mosses by C. tullia can be determined successfully from habitat data for sites. However, in areas where site extinction has progressed further, isolation is likely to be a more prominent factor. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We analyzed 16 years (199220132007) of butterfly transect count data from The Netherlands in a reevaluation of the trends of common, widespread species. Fifty-five percent (11 of 20 species) of these species suffered severe declines in distribution and abundance. Overall, cumulative butterfly abundance declined by around 30\%. Some of the species in decline used to be omnipresent in gardens and parks, and 2 of the species were previously considered agricultural pests. Based on their declines over the last 16 years, 2 of the 20 species (Lasiommata megera and Gonepteryx rhamni) reached endangered status in The Netherlands under the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) population-decline criterion, and 2 species (Inachis io and Thymelicus lineola) met vulnerable criterion. Butterflies in farmland, urban, and particularly woodland areas showed the largest decline in species abundance. The abundance of species associated with vegetation types found mainly in nature reserves (dunes, heathland, and, to a lesser extent, seminatural grassland) increased or remained stable. The decline of widespread species requires additional conservation strategies in the wider landscape. Los análisis de pérdidas de poblaciones típicamente muestran una dicotomía entre especies fuertemente afectadas, raras y localizadas y especies aparentemente no afectadas, comunes y con distribución amplia.

Las mariposas en áreas agrícolas, urbanas y particularmente en bosques mostraron la mayor declinación en abundancia de especies. La abundancia de especies asociada con tipos de vegetación encontrados principalmente en reservas naturales (dunas, matorrales, y, en menor grado, pastizal seminatural) incrementó o permaneció estable.

	abstract = {In evolutionary time, varying environments may lead to different morphs as a result of genetic adaptation and divergence or phenotypic plasticity. Landscapes that differ in the extent of habitat fragmentation may provide different selection regimes for dispersal, but also for other ecological functions. Several studies on flying insects have shown differences in flight morphology between landscapes, but whether such differences result from plastic responses have rarely been tested. We did a reciprocal transplant experiment with offspring of speckled wood butterfly females (Parargeaegeria) from three types of landscape differing in fragmentation: woodland landscape, landscape with woodland fragments and agricultural landscape with only hedgerows. Young caterpillars were allowed to grow individually on potted host grasses in small enclosures under the three landscape conditions (split-brood design). Mortality in caterpillars was much higher in agricultural landscape compared to the other landscapes. Additive to the effect of landscape of development, landscape of origin also affected mortality rate in a similar way. Flight morphology of the adults resulting from the experiment differed significantly with landscape. Independent of the landscape of origin, males and females that developed in agricultural landscape were the heaviest and had the greatest wing loadings. Females that developed in agricultural landscape had higher relative thorax mass (i.e. greater flight muscle allocation) in line with adaptive predictions on altered dispersal behaviour with type of landscape. In males, relative thorax mass did not respond significantly relative to landscape of development, but males originating from landscape with woodland fragments allocated more into their thorax compared to males from the other types. We found significant G?E interactions for total dry mass and wing loading. Our results suggest the existence of phenotypic plasticity in butterfly flight morphology associated with landscape structure.},

	abstract = {Many butterfly genera are characterised by the presence of marginal eyespots on their wings. One hypothesis to account for an occurrence of eyespots is that these wing pattern elements are partly the outcome of visual selection by predators. Bicyclus anynana (Satyrinae) has underside spotting on its wings but there is also a seasonal form in which the eyespots are reduced in size or totally absent. This natural variation gives us a useful tool to test the hypothesis that marginal eyespot patterns can decoy the attacking predator by, at least sometimes, diverting attack from vital body parts to the edges of the wings. We used lizards, Anolis carolinensis , and pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca , as predators for living spotted and spotless B. anynana . The presence of eyespots did not increase the escape probability of resting butterflies once captured (even a form with enlarged eyespots did not add to effective deflection of attacks). There was also no evidence that eyespots influenced the location of strikes by the predators. This study thus provides no support that marginal eyespot patterns can act as an effective deflection mechanism to avoid lizard or avian predation.},

	abstract = {Aim: Variation partitioning based on canonical analysis is the most commonly used analysis to investigate community patterns according to environmental and spatial predictors. Ecologists use this method in order to understand the pure contribution of the environment independent of space, and vice versa, as well as to control for inflated type I error in assessing the environmental component under spatial autocorrelation. Our goal is to use numerical simulations to compare how different spatial predictors and model selection procedures perform in assessing the importance of the spatial component and in controlling for type I error while testing environmental predictors.Innovation: We determine for the first time how the ability of commonly used (polynomial regressors) and novel methods based on eigenvector maps compare in the realm of spatial variation partitioning. We introduce a novel forward selection procedure to select spatial regressors for community analysis. Finally, we point out a number of issues that have not been previously considered about the joint explained variation between environment and space, which should be taken into account when reporting and testing the unique contributions of environment and space in patterning ecological communities.Main conclusions: In tests of species-environment relationships, spatial autocorrelation is known to inflate the level of type I error and make the tests of significance invalid. First, one must determine if the spatial component is significant using all spatial predictors (Moran's eigenvector maps). If it is, consider a model selection for the set of spatial predictors (an individual-species forward selection procedure is to be preferred) and use the environmental and selected spatial predictors in a partial regression or partial canonical analysis scheme. This is an effective way of controlling for type I error in such tests. Polynomial regressors do not provide tests with a correct level of type I error.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Maritime ringlet butterflies (Coenonympha nipisiquit McDunnough), an endangered species in Canada, inhabit salt marshes, which consist of microhabitat mosaics with varied larval survival rate. These microhabitats may influence the movement and reproductive behaviors of females, which in turn may affect population dynamics. I recorded behaviors and locations of females every minute with a GPS rover and calculated their move lengths and turning angles. Move lengths did not change in response to microhabitats, although turning angles became larger near bodies of water with sparse vegetation. Females spent a longer time in one location and oviposited more often where the principal larval host, Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl., is abundant, regardless of larval survival rate. Older females tended to initiate flight more readily than younger females and spent more time flying and nectaring. Younger females were more fecund and spent a longer time at one location. Because young females tend to be less mobile and more fecund, the majority of oviposition should take place near eclosion sites. However, some eggs will be laid away from microhabitats favorable to larval survival when older females become mobile and move out of their natal microhabitats. Because it seems to have little potential to colonize new habitat on its own, monitoring population dynamics and habitat quality will be crucial for the persistence and recovery of this rare species.},

This study examined historical records to describe   the movement of P. cresphontes populations into New York State and   adjacent Ontario. Climate data and field studies were used to identify,   environmental factors that may influence the range expansion, which was   found to correspond with an absence of September frosts beginning in   2001. Field studies indicated that some P cresphontes larvae were   capable of withstanding multiple frosts and descended to pupate normally   into late October in the range expansion area. Although the larvae may   have adapted to endure cooler temperatures to some degree, the effects   of warming temperatures on other factors such as natural enemies and   larval host plant quality in autumn may influence the spread of P   cresphontes populations at least as much as larval frost tolerance.},

	abstract = {Abstract:Conservation actions need to account for and be adapted to address changes that will occur under global climate change. The identification of stresses on biological diversity (as defined in the Convention on Biological Diversity) is key in the process of adaptive conservation management. We considered any impact of climate change on biological diversity a stress because such an effect represents a change (negative or positive) in key ecological attributes of an ecosystem or parts of it. We applied a systemic approach and a hierarchical framework in a comprehensive classification of stresses to biological diversity that are caused directly by global climate change. Through analyses of 20 conservation sites in 7 countries and a review of the literature, we identified climate-change-induced stresses. We grouped the identified stresses according to 3 levels of biological diversity: stresses that affect individuals and populations, stresses that affect biological communities, and stresses that affect ecosystem structure and function. For each stress category, we differentiated 3 hierarchical levels of stress: stress class (thematic grouping with the coarsest resolution, 8); general stresses (thematic groups of specific stresses, 21); and specific stresses (most detailed definition of stresses, 90). We also compiled an overview of effects of climate change on ecosystem services using the categories of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and 2 additional categories. Our classification may be used to identify key climate-change-related stresses to biological diversity and may assist in the development of appropriate conservation strategies. The classification is in list format, but it accounts for relations among climate-change-induced stresses.
Resumen:Las acciones de conservación requieren que se consideren los cambios que ocurrirán bajo los cambios climáticos y que se adapten para atenderlos. La identificación de de los tipos de estrés de la diversidad biológica (como la define la Convención sobre Diversidad Biológica) es clave en el proceso del manejo adaptativo para la conservación. Consideramos cualquier impacto de los cambios climáticos como un estrés porque tal efecto representa un cambio (negativo o positivo) en atributos ecológicos clave en un ecosistema o partes de él. Aplicamos un método sistemático y un marco de referencia jerárquico en una clasificación integral de los tipos de estrés de la diversidad biológica provocados directamente por el cambio climático global. Los identificamos mediante el análisis de 20 sitios de conservación en 7 países y la revisión de literatura. Agrupamos los tipos de estrés identificados de acuerdo con 3 niveles de diversidad biológica; aquellos que afectan individuos y poblaciones, aquellos que afectan comunidades biológicas y aquellos que afectan a la estructura y función del ecosistema. Para cada categoría de estrés, identificamos 3 niveles jerárquicos de estrés: clase de estrés (agrupación temática con la resolución más gruesa, 8); tipos de estrés generales (grupos temáticos de tipos de estrés específicos, 21) y tipos de estrés específicos (definición más detallada, 90). También compilamos una perspectiva general de los efectos del cambio climático sobre los servicios ecosistémicos utilizando las categorías del Millenium Ecosystem Assessment y dos categorías adicionales. Nuestra clasificación puede ser utilizada para identificar tipos de estrés clave relacionados con el cambio climático y puede ayudar al desarrollo de estrategias de conservación adecuadas. La clasificación está en formato de lista, pero toma en cuenta las relaciones entre los tipos de estrés inducidos por el cambio climático.},

	abstract = {Abstract. 1. The present study used the mountain specialist butterfly Parnassius apollo as a model system to investigate how climate change may alter habitat requirements for species at their warm range margins. 2. Larval habitat use was recorded in six P. apollo populations over a 700 m elevation gradient in the Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain). Larvae used four potential host species (Sedum spp.) growing in open areas amongst shrubs. 3. Parnassius apollo host-plant and habitat use changed as elevation increased: the primary host shifted from Sedum amplexicaule to Sedum brevifolium, and larvae selected more open microhabitats (increased bare ground and dead vegetation, reduced vegetation height and shrub cover), suggesting that hotter microhabitats are used in cooler environments. 4. Larval microhabitat selection was significantly related to ambient temperature. At temperatures lower than 27 °C, larvae occupied open microhabitats that were warmer than ambient temperature, versus more shaded microhabitats that were cooler than ambient conditions when temperature was higher than 27 °C. 5. Elevational changes in phenology influenced the temperatures experienced by larvae, and could affect local host-plant favourability. 6. Habitat heterogeneity appears to play an important role in P. apollo larval thermoregulation, and may become increasingly important in buffering populations of this and other insect species against climatic variation.},

Seven regions are proposed. The results showed two basic gradients, which apparently lead the butterfly species distributions within the study area: a north-east2013south-west one, related to altitude and species richness, and a west2013east one, implying a humidity or lithologic gradient. The Balearic Islands remain as an independent region in all cases. The observed divisions probably reflect the distribution of species richness in the study area. Characteristic species for each of the regions were identified using a numerical preference index. The network of protected areas is well represented in all of the sectors proposed, although three of the proposed sub-sectors are under-represented if sampling effort is taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {Much research has centered on determining which habitat model best predicts species occurrence. However, previous work typically used data sets that are inherently biased for evaluation. The use of simulated data provides a way of testing model performance using un-biased data where the true relationships between species occurrence and population processes are predefined using sound ecological theory. We used a process-based habitat model to generate simulated occurrence data to evaluate presence2013absence and presence2013only methods: generalized linear and generalized additive models (GLM, GAM), maximum entropy model (Maxent), and discrete choice models (DCM). This is the first study to use a DCM for predicting species distributions. We varied the effect that habitat quality had on fecundity and reported the model responses to these changes. When the effect of habitat quality on fecundity was weak, model performance was no better than random for all methods, however, performance increased as the habitat/fecundity relationship became stronger. For each level of habitat quality effect, there was little variation in performance between the presence2013absence and presence2013only methods. The use of a process-based habitat model to generate occurrence data for evaluating model performance has a distinct advantage over other testing methods, because no errors are made during sampling and the true ecological relationships between population process and species occurrence are known. This leads to un-biased results and increased confidence in assessing model performance and making management recommendations.},

	abstract = {In light of the wide-scale replacement of native plants in North America with introduced, invasive species and noninvasive ornamental plants that evolved elsewhere, we compared the value of native and introduced plants in terms of their ability to serve as host plants for Lepidoptera. Insect herbivores such as Lepidoptera larvae are critically important components of terrestrial food webs and any reduction in their biomass or diversity due to the loss of acceptable host plants is predicted to reduce the production of the many insectivores in higher trophic levels. We conducted an exhaustive search of host records in the literature. We used the data we gathered to rank all 1385 plant genera that occur in the mid-Atlantic states of the United States by their ability to support Lepidoptera richness. Statistical comparisons were made with Welch's test for equality of means. Woody plants supported more species of moths and butterflies than herbaceous plants, native plants supported more species than introduced plants, and native woody plants with ornamental value supported more Lepidoptera species than introduced woody ornamentals. All these differences were highly significant. Our rankings provide a relative measure that will be useful for restoration ecologists, landscape architects and designers, land managers, and landowners who wish to raise the carrying capacity of particular areas by selecting plants with the greatest capacity for supporting biodiversity. A la luz del reemplazo a gran escala de plantas nativas en Norte América con especies de plantas ornamentales introducidas, invasoras y no invasoras, que evolucionaron en otra parte, comparamos el valor de plantas nativas e introducidas en términos de su habilidad para funcionar como plantas huésped de Lepidoptera. Los insectos herbívoros como las larvas de lepidópteros son componentes críticamente importantes para las redes tróficas terrestres y se predice que cualquier reducción en su biomasa o diversidad debido a la pérdida de plantas huésped aceptables disminuirá la producción de muchos insectívoros en niveles tróficos superiores. Realizamos una búsqueda exhaustiva de registros de huéspedes en la literatura. Utilizamos los datos recabados para clasificar a los 1385 géneros de plantas que ocurren en los estados del medio Atlántico de los Estados Unidos por su habilidad para soportar riqueza de Lepidoptera. Realizamos comparaciones estadísticas con la prueba de Welch para igualdad de medias. Las plantas leñosas soportaron más especies de polillas y mariposas que las plantas herbáceas, las plantas nativas soportaron más especies que las especies introducidas, y las plantas leñosas nativas con valor ornamental soportaron más especies de Lepidópteros que las ornamentales leñosas introducidas. Todas estas diferencias fueron muy significativas. Nuestras clasificaciones proporcionan una medida relativa que seráútil para ecólogos restauradores, arquitectos y diseñadores de paisaje, gestores y propietarios de tierras que deseen incrementar la capacidad de carga de ciertas áreas mediante la selección de plantas con la mayor capacidad para soportar biodiversidad.},

Our model includes variable dispersal distances and exhibits qualitatively different behaviour from the cases of nearest-neighbour dispersal and finite periodic landscapes that have previously been studied. We show that different dispersal distances and even different dispersal kernels produce identical species-area curves up to rescaling of the two axes. This scaling property provides a straightforward method for fitting the model to empirical data. The species-area curves display all three phases observed empirically and enable the exponent describing the power law relationship for species-area curves to be identified as the gradient at the central phase. This exponent can take all values between 0 and 1 and is given by a simple function of the speciation rate, independent of all other model variables.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Global climate change is frequently considered a major conservation threat. The Earth's climate has already warmed by 0.5Â° C over the past century, and recent studies show that it is possible to detect the effects of a changing climate on ecological systems. This suggests that global change may be a current and future conservation threat. Changes in recent decades are apparent at all levels of ecological organization: population and life-history changes, shifts in geographic range, changes in species composition of communities, and changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. These ecological effects can be linked to recent population declines and to both local and global extinctions of species. Although it is impossible to prove that climate change is the cause of these ecological effects, these findings have important implications for conservation biology. It is no longer safe to assume that all of a species' historic range remains suitable. In drawing attention to the importance of climate change as a current threat to species, these studies emphasize the need for current conservation efforts to consider climate change in both in situ conservation and reintroduction efforts. Additional threats will emerge as climate continues to change, especially as climate interacts with other stressors such as habitat fragmentation. These studies can contribute to preparations for future challenges by providing valuable input to models and direct examples of how species respond to climate change.
Resumen: El cambio climÃ¡tico global es frecuentemente considerado como una gran amenaza para la conservaciÃ³n. Sin embargo, el clima de la tierra ya se ha calentado 0.5Â° C a lo largo del siglo pasado y estudios recientes muestran que es posible detectar los efectos de un clima cambiante en los sistemas ecolÃ³gicos. Esto sugiere que el cambio global puede ser una amenaza presente y futura para la conservaciÃ³n. Los cambios en las dÃ©cadas recientes son aparentes a todos los niveles de organizaciÃ³n ecolÃ³gica: cambios poblacionales y de historia de vida, sesgos en el rango geogrÃ¡fico, cambios en la composiciÃ³n de especies en comunidades y cambios en la estructura y funcionamiento de ecosistemas. Estos efectos ecolÃ³gicos pueden estar ligados a disminuciones poblacionales recientes y a la extinciÃ³n de especies tanto en el Ã¡mbito local como global. A pesar de que es imposible probar que el cambio climÃ¡tico es la causa de estos efectos ecolÃ³gicos, estos estudios tienen implicaciones importantes para la biologÃa de la conservaciÃ³n. Ya no es seguro asumir que todo el rango histÃ³rico de una especie permanece apto. Al llamar la atenciÃ³n sobre la importancia del cambio climÃ¡tico como una amenaza actual para las especies, estos estudios hacen Ã©nfasis en la necesidad de esfuerzos de conservaciÃ³n contemporÃ¡neos que tomen en consideraciÃ³n el cambio climÃ¡tico tanto para esfuerzos de conservaciÃ³n in situ, como de reintroducciÃ³n. EmergerÃ¡n amenazas adicionales en tanto el clima continÃºe cambiando, especialmente al interactuar el clima con otros estresores como la fragmentaciÃ³n del hÃ¡bitat. Estos estudios pueden contribuir en la preparaciÃ³n de desafÃos a futuro al proveer datos valiosos para los modelos y encauzar ejemplos sobre las respuestas de las especies al cambio climÃ¡tico.},

	abstract = {1. Nine metapopulations of the butterfly Plebejus argus were mapped in North Wales in 1983 and 1990. The metapopulations occurred in three biotopes; five were in heathland, one in mossland and three in limestone grassland. 2. Within metapopulations, local distributions of the butterfly corresponded to the spatial distributions of suitable habitat: P. argus was able to colonize virtually all suitable habitat patches that were less than 1 km from existing, populated patches. 3. In contrast, the regional distribution was constrained by the inability of the butterfly to colonize suitable habitat that was further than a few kilometres from existing metapopulations; some of these sites are now populated by P. argus following successful introductions. 4. Turnover (extinctions and colonizations) of patches within metapopulations was relatively high in small patches. Turnover was also greater in heathland than in limestone: the principal reason for this was that patches of habitat were usually smaller in heathland, and small patches had high turnover in both biotopes. 5. Some patches changed in shape and size. Turnover of area was greater in heathland, where the butterfly occupies relatively transient successional habitats, than in limestone grassland where the habitat can be maintained in a suitable condition for longer periods. 6. The persistence of this spatially dynamic species depends on some suitable habitat being continuously available within relatively large areas of biotope. If the continuity is broken and a whole metapopulation becomes extinct, natural recolonization is unlikely to occur if the nearest P. argus source is more than a few kilometres away.},

	abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) provide a convenient approach to modeling a system comprised of homogeneous entities that, generally, have a spatial relationship with one another. CA are used to model systems that can be appropriately represented as a collection of interconnected automata. These networked automata may act as either a model representation of the entire system, or used to model a sub-system within a hybrid system. As the sub-systems within a hybrid system are disparate, so too can the models representing them be disparate using a multi-model approach. However, to take advantage of multi-modeling, CA and other models used to represent the sub-systems must be founded on system-theoretical principles. Furthermore, each model's formalism must account for input and output data exchange with other modeling formalisms. Therefore, to support modular synthesis of distinct CA models with non-CA models, a composable cellular automata (CCA) formalism is proposed. This formalism is provided as a domain-neutral, mathematical specification. The CCA is then exemplified as part of a multi-model, and the GRASS development environment is used to describe one possible implementation approach.},

	abstract = {Both landscape structure and population size fluctuations influence population genetics. While independent effects of these factors on genetic patterns and processes are well studied, a key challenge is to understand their interaction, as populations are simultaneously exposed to habitat fragmentation and climatic changes that increase variability in population size. In a population network of an alpine butterfly, abundance declined 60–100\% in 2003 because of low over-winter survival. Across the network, mean microsatellite genetic diversity did not change. However, patch connectivity and local severity of the collapse interacted to determine allelic richness change within populations, indicating that patch connectivity can mediate genetic response to a demographic collapse. The collapse strongly affected spatial genetic structure, leading to a breakdown of isolation-by-distance and loss of landscape genetic pattern. Our study reveals important interactions between landscape structure and temporal demographic variability on the genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of populations. Projected future changes to both landscape and climate may lead to loss of genetic variability from the studied populations, and selection acting on adaptive variation will likely occur within the context of an increasing influence of genetic drift.},

Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.},

	abstract = {The widely used FD index of functional diversity is based on the construction of a dendrogram. This index has been the subject of a strong debate concerning the choice of the distance and the clustering method to be used, since the method chosen may greatly affect the FD values obtained. Much of this debate has been centred around which method of dendrogram construction gives a faithful representation of species distribution in multidimensional functional trait space. From artificially generated datasets varying in species richness and correlations between traits, we test whether any single combination of clustering method(s) and distance consistently produces a dendrogram that most closely corresponds to the matrix of functional distances between pairs of species studied. We also test the ability of consensus trees, which incorporate features common to a range of different dendrograms, to summarize distance matrices. Our results show that no combination of clustering method(s) and distance constantly outperforms the others due to the complexity of interactions between correlations of traits, species richness, distance measures and clustering methods. Furthermore, the construction of a consensus tree from a range of dendrograms is often the best solution. Consequently, we recommend testing all combinations of distances and clustering methods (including consensus trees), then selecting the most reliable tree (with the lowest dissimilarity) to estimate FD value. Furthermore we suggest that any index that requires the construction of functional dendrograms potentially benefits from this new approach.},

Based on logistic regression, we developed habitat distribution models for the burnet moth Zygaena carniolica and the nymphalid butterfly Coenonympha arcania in Northern Bavaria, Germany. The relation between adult occurrence and habitat parameters, including the influence of landscape context, was analyzed on 118 sites. Habitat connectivity analyses were carried out on the basis of (1) habitat suitability maps generated from these models and (2) dispersal data from mark recapture studies. Our results showed that (1) the presence of the burnet depended mainly on the presence of nectar plants and of nutrient-poor dry grasslands in direct vicinity, that of the nymphalid on larger areas of extensively used dry grasslands within 100 m vicinity in combination with small patches of higher shrubs and bushes. (2) Internal as well as external validation indicated the robustness and general applicability of the models. Transferability in time and space indicated their high potential relevance for applications in nature conservation, such as predicting possible effects of land use changes. (3) Habitat connectivity analyses revealed a high degree of habitat connectivity within the study area. Thus, we could show no effects of isolation or habitat size for both species.},

	abstract = {The Earth's atmosphere has a natural greenhouse effect, without which the global mean surface temperature would be about 33 ?C lower and life would not be possible. Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases in trace amounts. This has enhanced the greenhouse effect, resulting in surface warming. Were it not for the partly offsetting effects of increased aerosol concentrations, the increase in global mean surface temperature over the past 100 years would be larger than observed. Continued surface warming through the 21st century is inevitable and will likely have widespread ecological impacts. The magnitude and rate of warming for the global average will be largely dictated by the strength and direction of climate feedbacks, thermal inertia of the oceans, the rate of greenhouse gas emissions, and aerosol concentrations. Because of regional expressions of climate feedbacks, changes in atmospheric circulation, and a suite of other factors, the magnitude and rate of warming and changes in other key climate elements, such as precipitation, will not be uniform across the planet. For example, due to loss of its floating sea-ice cover, the Arctic will warm the most.

However, the potential for forest regeneration has slowed, and the extent of regional forest cover has declined by more than 4.0\%. Using
remote-sensing data, statistical sampling, and change-detection methods, this research shows how land conversion varies spatially and temporally
across the East from 1973-2000, and how those changes affect regional land-change dynamics. The analysis shows that agricultural land use has
continued to decline, and that this enables forest recovery; however, an important land-cover transition has occurred, from a mode of regional
forest-cover gain to one of forest-cover loss caused by timber cutting cycles, urbanization, and other land-use demands.},

The function is useful in predicting fitness differences among individuals and in revealing whether an optimum is present within the range of phenotypes in the population. It may also be thought of as describing the ecological environment in terms of the trait. Quadratic regression will approximate the fitness function from data (e.g., Lande and Arnold, 1983), but the method does not reliably indicate features of f such as the presence of modes (stabilizing selection) or dips (disruptive selection). I employ an alternative procedure requiring no a priori model for the function. The method is useful in two ways: it provides a nonparametric estimate of f, interest by itself, and it can be used to suggest an appropriate parametric model. I also discuss measures of selection intensity based on the fitness function. Analysis of six data sets yields a variety of forms of f and provides new insight for some familiar cases. Low amounts of variation and a low density of data points near the tails of many phenotype distributions emerge as limitations to gaining information on fitness functions. An experimental approach in which the distribution of a quantitative trait is broadened through manipulation would minimize these problems.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive mechanistic approach to dispersal requires the translation of the whole mobility register of the target organism into movement rules that could subsequently be used to model its displacements. According to the optimality paradigm, this procedure implies a cost-benefit analysis of mobility patterns taking into account not only movements, but also their external context and the internal state of the moving individuals. Using this framework, we detected a 'dispersal mood' in some individuals of the meadow brown butterfly Maniola jurtina. These adopted a direct flight strategy, which was topologically different from the previously documented foray search strategy. Those individuals that used the direct flight strategy moved straighter as soon as they left the habitat and avoided heading back to their patch of origin, which is the best inter-patch search strategy when dispersal risks and costs are high. The direct flight strategy was conditional to sex: females used it twice as much as males. We suggest that this sex bias was due to female investment in offspring, which is maximized by male avoidance and spatial bet hedging. Inter-patch dispersal of gravid females is crucial for the persistence of M. jurtina populations in spatially and temporally unpredictable environments.},

	abstract = {1. Theoretical studies of the costs and benefits of migration predict that evolutionary changes in dispersal traits may take place in response to habitat fragmentation. 2. For the butterfly Plebejus argus, we investigated five morphological characters potentially associated with flight ability, in locations that varied in level of habitat fragmentation. The traits were: total mass, relative thorax mass (containing flight muscle), relative abdomen mass (containing reproductive organs), relative wing area and wing aspect ratio. All characters were measured on individuals reared in a common environment. 3. Morphology was related to the level of habitat fragmentation in both limestone and heathland habitats. Total mass increased with decreasing heathland habitat area (over the range 13 000201310 ha). Relative allocation to the thorax increased, while allocation to the abdomen decreased, with declining limestone habitat area (over the range 3?520130?2 ha). Morphological characters were not significantly correlated with habitat isolation. 4. Significant family effects for total mass, relative thorax mass, relative abdomen mass and (for females only) relative wing area indicate that these traits may have a heritable component, and therefore have the potential to respond to selection acting on flight ability. 5. We suggest that evolutionary changes in life history traits are taking place in response to changes in landscape structure: in P. argus, these traits may be influenced by the effects of mate-location strategy on emigration rates. Specific changes in traits can be complex, and may vary among species and populations. 6. P. argus had a 50\% chance of occurring in heathland fragments of 33 ha, and was present on all heathlands above 50 ha, but population systems may not yet have achieved equilibrium. P. argus is unlikely to undertake major evolutionary changes in response to reduced habitat area in heathlands {\textgreater} 50 ha. Extinctions from smaller heathlands can be explained most plausibly by population/vegetation dynamics. Therefore, evolutionary changes in morphology may be more likely to be symptomatic of populations with altered costs and benefits of migration, rather than to be a direct cause of extinction.},

	abstract = {This article highlights how the loose definition of the term 'refugia' has led to discrepancies in methods used to assess the vulnerability of species to the current trend of rising global temperatures. The term 'refugia' is commonly used without distinguishing between macrorefugia and microrefugia, ex situ refugia and in situ refugia, glacial and interglacial refugia or refugia based on habitat stability and refugia based on climatic stability. It is not always clear which definition is being used, and this makes it difficult to assess the appropriateness of the methods employed. For example, it is crucial to develop accurate fine-scale climate grids when identifying microrefugia, but coarse-scale macroclimate might be adequate for determining macrorefugia. Similarly, identifying in situ refugia might be more appropriate for species with poor dispersal ability but this may overestimate the extinction risk for good dispersers. More care needs to be taken to properly define the context when referring to refugia from climate change so that the validity of methods and the conservation significance of refugia can be assessed.},

Each symposium focused on a specific subject, and all the subjects could be classified into three broad categories: theoretical development, population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Following discussions with the symposia organizers, which indicated that they all shared similar issues and concerns, the facilitated discussions were task-oriented around four basic questions: (1) key challenges in the research area, (2) generating and sharing new ideas, (3) improving collaboration and networking, and (4) increasing visibility to decision-makers, partners and clients. Common challenges that emerged from the symposia included the need for improved communication and collaboration among different academic disciplines, further progress in both theoretical and practical modelling approaches, and accentuation of technology transfer. Regarding the generation and sharing of new ideas, the main issue that emerged was the type of positive interactions that should be encouraged among potential collaborators. The usefulness of the Internet, particularly for the sharing of open-source software and conducting discussion forums, was highlighted for improving collaboration and networking. Several communication tools are available today, and it is important for modellers to use them more intensively. Visibility can be increased by publishing professional newsletters, maintaining informal contacts with the public, organizing educational sessions in primary and secondary schools, and developing simplified analytical frameworks and pilot studies. Specific issues raised in each symposium are also discussed.},

In response to anticipated effects of climate change, conservation organizations and government agencies are developing "adaptation strategies" to facilitate the adjustment of human society and ecological systems to altered climate regimes. We reviewed the literature and climate-change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, México, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate-change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change.},

In particular we show how ongoing astrobiological studies of the coupled relationship between life, planets and their co-evolution can inform new perspectives and direct new studies in sustainability science. Using the Drake Equation as a vehicle to explore the gamut of astrobiology, we focus on its most import factor for sustainability: the mean lifetime L ¯ of an ensemble of Species with Energy-Intensive Technology (SWEIT). We cast the problem into the language of dynamical system theory and introduce the concept of a trajectory bundle for SWEIT evolution. We then discuss how astrobiological results usefully inform the creation of dynamical equations, their constraints and initial conditions. Three specific examples of how astrobiological considerations can be folded into discussions of sustainability are discussed: (1) concepts of planetary habitability, (2) mass extinctions and their possible relation to the current, so-called Anthropocene epoch, and (3) today's changes in atmospheric chemistry (and the climate change it entails) in the context of pervious epochs of biosphere-driven atmospheric and climate alteration (i.e. the Great Oxidation Event).},

	abstract = {1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.},

However, whether an ecophysiological phenomenon can affect large-scale biogeographical patterns of insects is largely unknown. Insects absorb energy from the sun to become mobile, and their colouration varies depending on the prevailing climate where they live. Here we show, using data of 473 European butterfly and dragonfly species, that dark-coloured insect species are favoured in cooler climates and light-coloured species in warmer climates. By comparing distribution maps of dragonflies from 1988 and 2006, we provide support for a mechanistic link between climate, functional traits and species that affects geographical distributions even at continental scales. Our results constitute a foundation for better forecasting the effect of climate change on many insect groups.},

	abstract = {To understand how urbanization has transformed the desert landscape in the central Arizona - Phoenix region of the United States, we conducted a series of spatial analyses of the land-use pattern from 1912-1995. The results of the spatial analysis show that the extent of urban area has increased exponentially for the past 83 years, and this urban expansion is correlated with the increase in population size for the same period of time. The accelerating urbanization process has increased the degree of fragmentation and structural complexity of the desert landscape. To simulate land-use change we developed a Markov-cellular automata model. Model parameters and neighborhood rules were obtained both empirically and with a modified genetic algorithm. Land-use maps for 1975 and 1995 were used to implement the model at two distinct spatial scales with a time step of one year. Model performance was evaluated using Monte-Carlo confidence interval estimation for selected landscape pattern indices. The coarse-scale model simulated the statistical patterns of the landscape at a higher accuracy than the fine-scale model. The empirically derived parameter set poorly simulated land-use change as compared to the optimized parameter set. In summary, our results showed that landscape pattern metrics (patch density, edge density, fractal dimension, contagion) together were able to effectively capture the trend in land-use associated with urbanization for this region. The Markov-cellular automata parameterized by a modified genetic algorithm reasonably replicated the change in land-use pattern.},

However, there exist very little knowledge about their spatio-temporal distribution and diversity in agricultural systems of Sub-Sahara Africa and in Uganda. There are no protocols to monitor the status of good pollinator species in these systems. The main aim of this study was to collect baseline information about indicator species of butterfly community in coffee–banana farming systems of central Uganda. Data were collected for 1 year (2006) using banana fruit-bait traps, transect walk-and-counts and hand-nets sampling methods. Indicator species of farmland habitats were identified using indicator value method. Species that emerged as significant (P {\textless} 0.05) suitable indicators were Catopsilia florella, Junonia sophia, Bicyclus safitza, Acraea acerata, Eurema hecabe, Ypthima albida, Zizula hylax, Acraea ventura, Eurema brigitta, Neptidopsis ophione, Junonia eonone, Zizeeria kynsna, Cupidopsis cissus, Junonia chorimene and Acrae uvui. These ubiquitous species were recommended to monitoring programmes as indicator species of butterfly communities delivering pollination services to cultivated and wild plants in farmland environments of central Uganda. Transect count was proposed as the best sampling technique to monitor butterfly species that may be involved in successful pollination activities in farmlands. There is a need to develop strategies to protect linear and nonlinear natural and semi-natural habitats to offer sufficient refugia and breeding sites to butterflies inhabiting farmlands.},

We used Poisson regression to develop a predictive model of species richness of resident butterflies in the central Great Basin of western North America. Species inventory data and values for 14 environmental variables from 49 locations (canyon segments) in the Toquima Range (Nevada, USA) were used to build the model. We also included squares of the environmental variables to accommodate potential non-linear relationships. Species richness of butterflies was a significant function of elevation and local topographic heterogeneity, with the selected model explaining 57\% of the total deviance of species richness. Predictive variables can be derived efficiently from GIS-based data for areas in which species inventories have not yet been conducted. Therefore, in addition to evaluating the ability of the model to explain observed variation in species richness, we generated and tested predictions of species richness for [`]new' locations that had not been used to build the model. Predictions were effective for five new segments also located in the Toquima Range, but not for 22 new segments in the nearby Shoshone Range. We discuss issues related to generalizability and data quality in model development.},

Coenonympha tullia larvae living on cottonsedge tussocks Eriophorum vaginatum in the base of peat cuttings will be inundated by the rising water levels under such management regimes. The submergence of overwintering C. tullia larvae was found to have a marked impact on their long term survival. The numbers of larvae that survived to resume feeding the following spring was lower for all submergence times (3 to 108 days) compared with controls; no larvae survived a submergence period of 108 days. Total submergence had two effects. First, it caused an immediate increase in mortality after 7 days (with larval death occurring under water) and second, a longer term increase in mortality over the next few months. Behavioural tests suggested that C. tullia larvae usually respond to the raising of water levels by trying to climb out of the water. Results suggest that, on sites where the conservation of C. tullia is important, water levels should not be raised so high as to totally submerge E. vaginatum foodplants containing C. tullia larvae until E. vaginatum has spread sufficiently on the higher peat surface to provide a replacement habitat.},

After an assessment of the rarity and distribution of this species, in Europe and in France, results are presented about the monitoring of two experimental stations, where an evaluation of population was made, together with a study of imaginal biology and behaviour.

ecology, medicine, or even market research, that commonly deal with dendrogram-based
analyses. In such analyses, for a given initial dissimilarity matrix, the resulting dendrogram
may strongly vary according to the selected clustering methods. However, numerous
dendrogram-based analyses require adequate measurement for assessing of which of the
clustering methods preserves most faithfully the initial dissimilarity matrix. While cophenetic
correlation coefficient-based measures have been widely used for this purpose, we emphasize
here that it is not always a suitable approach. We thus propose a measure based on a matrix
norm, the 2-norm, to adequately check which of the resulting ultrametric distance matrices
related to the dendrograms is the closest to the initial dissimilarity matrix. In addition, we also
propose an objective way to define a benchmark value (threshold value) in order to assess
whether the degree of conformity between the ultrametric distance matrix selected and the
initial dissimilarity matrix is satisfactory. Our proposal may notably be incorporated within a
recently proposed approach that involves the use of clustering methods in environmental
science and beyond. In ecology, various functional diversity indices based on clustering species
from their functional dissimilarities may benefit from this overall approach.},

	abstract = {Unlike many insects, the caterpillars of the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae, are less abundant on host plants that grow in large dense stands than on hosts that are scattered sparsely in diverse vegetation. In this study we describe how the flight behavior of ovipositing P. rapae results in the placement of more eggs on isolated hosts. The flight paths of females were measured in terms of move lengths and tuning angles; this permitted us to analyze the flight as a sequence of movement vectors punctuated by landings and oviposition. A variety of tests revealed that the butterflies conformed with the assumptions required to describe their flight as a Markov process. Females ovipositing in potato—collard bicultures behave identically to females oviposition in collard monocultures. In gardens containing collards planted at different spacings, females make shorter moves and land more frequently when encountering dense stands of collars. Under all circumstances, however, ovipositing butterflies tend to follow linear routes of flight. As a result of this directionality, the number of eggs laid per plant declines with increases in host plant density, even when these increases in host concentration prompt shorter moves. Females foraging for nectar, on the other hand, readily abandon their linear flight paths. By engaging in tight turning behavior in clumps of flowers, nectar—feeding butterflies concentrate their activities in resource patches. The differences between the nectar—feeding and ovipositional flights highlight an "egg—spreading syndrome." In particular, three features of P. rapae oviposition behavior enhance each female's tendency to spread her eggs widely: (1) eggs are usually laid singly on plants, (2) females tend to follow linear flight paths, and (3) females typically pass over many suitable hosts. Such behavior cannot be the product of natural selection acting solely to increase energetic efficiency or competitive ability. We evaluate several adaptive explanations for this egg—spreading syndrome and exclude all but one. The remaining hypothesis is that P. rapae scatter their eggs widely to "spread the risk" and minimize the generation—to—generation variance in replacement rates. To estimate the potential advantages accrued by egg spreading, we use data on the spatial variability in survivorship to simulate the replacement rates that would be achieved by scattering eggs on different plants within a garden and in different gardens within a region. Although this simulation cannot prove the risk—spreading hypothesis, it does demonstrate the effectiveness of egg spreading in averaging out observed variations in larval survivorship. The variability in P. rapae survivorship appears to be associated with the highly unpredictable milieu (local herbivore load, plant condition, etc.) of a developing caterpillar. The implications of such unpredictability to evolution and community organization are discussed.},

As synthetic biology techniques become more powerful, researchers are anticipating a future in which the design of biological circuits will be similar to the design of integrated circuits in electronics. Nielsen et al. describe what is essentially a programming language to design computational circuits in living cells. The circuits generated on plasmids expressed in Escherichia coli required careful insulation from their genetic context, but primarily functioned as specified. The circuits could, for example, regulate cellular functions in response to multiple environmental signals. Such a strategy can facilitate the development of more complex circuits by genetic engineering.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONCells respond to their environment, make decisions, build structures, and coordinate tasks. Underlying these processes are computational operations performed by networks of regulatory proteins that integrate signals and control the timing of gene expression. Harnessing this capability is critical for biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization. It has been shown that cells can be programmed using synthetic genetic circuits composed of regulators organized to generate a desired operation. However, the construction of even simple circuits is time-intensive and unreliable.
RATIONALEElectronic design automation (EDA) was developed to aid engineers in the design of semiconductor-based electronics. In an effort to accelerate genetic circuit design, we applied principles from EDA to enable increased circuit complexity and to simplify the incorporation of synthetic gene regulation into genetic engineering projects. We used the hardware description language Verilog to enable a user to describe a circuit function. The user also specifies the sensors, actuators, and “user constraints file” (UCF), which defines the organism, gate technology, and valid operating conditions. Cello (www.cellocad.org) uses this information to automatically design a DNA sequence encoding the desired circuit. This is done via a set of algorithms that parse the Verilog text, create the circuit diagram, assign gates, balance constraints to build the DNA, and simulate performance.
RESULTSCello designs circuits by drawing upon a library of Boolean logic gates. Here, the gate technology consists of NOT/NOR logic based on repressors. Gate connection is simplified by defining the input and output signals as RNA polymerase (RNAP) fluxes. We found that the gates need to be insulated from their genetic context to function reliably in the context of different circuits. Each gate is isolated using strong terminators to block RNAP leakage, and input interchangeability is improved using ribozymes and promoter spacers. These parts are varied for each gate to avoid breakage due to recombination. Measuring the load of each gate and incorporating this into the optimization algorithms further reduces evolutionary pressure.Cello was applied to the design of 60 circuits for Escherichia coli, where the circuit function was specified using Verilog code and transformed to a DNA sequence. The DNA sequences were built as specified with no additional tuning, requiring 880,000 base pairs of DNA assembly. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts). Across all circuits, 92\% of the 412 output states functioned as predicted.
CONCLUSIONOur work constitutes a hardware description language for programming living cells. This required the co-development of design algorithms with gates that are sufficiently simple and robust to be connected by automated algorithms. We demonstrate that engineering principles can be applied to identify and suppress errors that complicate the compositions of larger systems. This approach leads to highly repetitive and modular genetics, in stark contrast to the encoding of natural regulatory networks. The use of a hardware-independent language and the creation of additional UCFs will allow a single design to be transformed into DNA for different organisms, genetic endpoints, operating conditions, and gate technologies.

Computation can be performed in living cells by DNA-encoded circuits that process sensory information and control biological functions. Their construction is time-intensive, requiring manual part assembly and balancing of regulator expression. We describe a design environment, Cello, in which a user writes Verilog code that is automatically transformed into a DNA sequence. Algorithms build a circuit diagram, assign and connect gates, and simulate performance. Reliable circuit design requires the insulation of gates from genetic context, so that they function identically when used in different circuits. We used Cello to design 60 circuits for Escherichia coli (880,000 base pairs of DNA), for which each DNA sequence was built as predicted by the software with no additional tuning. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts), and across all circuits 92\% of the output states functioned as predicted. Design automation simplifies the incorporation of genetic circuits into biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization.

	abstract = {Historically, morphological variation has been used to classify many species (and subspecies) of Lepidoptera. However, some of this variation may be unsuitable for inferring the recent evolutionary history of populations. Genetic data provide an alternative. We examine the morphological and genetic variation within and between British subspecies of Coenonympha tullia (Muller 1764) to test the hypothesis that neutral genetic variation corresponds to morphological variation. We find that most morphological and genetic variation occurs within populations and that those populations designated as subspecies based on morphological characters are not necessarily most closely related for mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA (amplified fragment length polymorphisms and allozymes). Thus, the notion that wing spot variation reflects population isolation and therefore genetic differentiation does not hold. The present study highlights the need for genetic data where taxonomy may be based on environmentally plastic or locally adapted characters because such characters will not reflect the true population genetic history.

	abstract = {Some scientific modelers suggest that complex simulation models that mimic biological processes should have a limited place in ecological and evolutionary studies. However, complex simulation models can have a role that is different from that of simpler models that are designed to be fit to data. Simulation can be viewed as another kind of experimental system and should be analyzed as such. Here, I argue that current discussions in the philosophy of science and in the physical sciences fields about the use of simulation as an experimental system have important implications for biology, especially complex sciences such as evolution and ecology. Simulation models can be used to mimic complex systems, but unlike nature, can be manipulated in ways that would be impossible, too costly or unethical to do in natural systems. Simulation can add to theory development and testing, can offer hypotheses about the way the world works and can give guidance as to which data are most important to gather experimentally.},

Eight of ten independent, variable loci exhibit step-clines in allele frequency; step-clines also occur in four wing pattern characters. Populations from the old part of the range are univoltine, and have significantly less genetic and morphological variation than populations from the recently colonized ranger, which arc bivoltine. The concordance of life history with genetic and morphological variation suggests that differences between univoltine and bivoltine populations are maintained by selection. Increased electrophoretic variation in the recently colonized range may have arisen by selection on rare variants within the old part of the range.},

	abstract = {Regular grids or lattices are frequently used to study ecosystems, for observations, experiments and simulations. The regular rectangular or square grid is used more often than the hexagonal grid, but their relative merits have been little discussed. Here we compare rectangular and hexagonal grids for ecological applications. We focus on the reasons some researchers have preferred hexagonal grids and methods to facilitate the use of hexagonal grids. We consider modelling and other applications, including the role of nearest neighbourhood in experimental design, the representation of connectivity in maps, and a new method for performing field surveys using hexagonal grids, which was demonstrated on montane heath vegetation. The rectangular grid is generally preferred because of its symmetrical, orthogonal co-ordinate system and the frequent use of rasters from Geographic Information Systems. Cells in a rectangular grid can also easily be combined to produce new grids with lower resolutions. However, efficient co-ordinate systems and multi-resolution partitions using the hexagonal grid are available. The nearest neighbourhood in a hexagonal grid is simpler and less ambiguous than in a rectangular grid. When nearest neighbourhood, movement paths or connectivity are important, the rectangular grid may not be suitable. We also investigate important differences between visualizations using hexagonal and rectangular grids. A survey of recent uses of grids in Ecological Modelling suggested that hexagonal grids are rarely used, even in applications for which they are more suitable than rectangular grids, e.g. connectivity and movement paths. Researchers should consider their choice of grid at an early stage in project development, and authors should explain the reasons for their choices.},

	abstract = {Adult fitness components may strongly depend on variation in locomotory performance such as flight; this variation can be sex specific. Fast take-off to intercept females and competing males is an essential behavioral component of the territorial perching behavior in male speckled wood butterflies (Pararge aegeria L.). Females on the other hand avoid frequent take-offs particularly under suboptimal temperatures, typically showing fewer but longer flights than males. We estimated the heritability of take-off acceleration performance under suboptimal body temperatures by a restricted maximum-likelihood model. We calculated genetic correlations between this performance and a selection of morphological traits: size (body mass), flight muscle investment (relative thorax mass), and wing shape (forewing aspect ratio). Our results show significant additive genetic variation for mean acceleration performance and a similar but nonsignificant trend (P= 0.08) for maximal acceleration performance during take-off in males (h2= 0.15). In females, heritability was not significantly different from zero for either of the acceleration performance measures. Morphological traits and take-off performance were genetically linked in a sex-specific way. In males, relative thorax mass and forewing aspect ratio were positively genetically correlated with acceleration performance. In females, there was a negative genetic correlation between acceleration performance and abdomen mass, but not with residual abdomen mass (i.e., regressed on total body mass). To fully understand the evolution of sexual differences in flight performances and morphology, several other flight performances will have to be included. This multifunctional nature of flight and its consequences for the evolutionary study of flight has not yet been fully appreciated in the literature.},

Behavioural and life history aspects can be implemented in IBMs through adaptive models based on genetic algorithms and neural networks (individual-based-neural network-genetic algorithm, ING). To investigate the precision of the adaptation process, we present three cases where solutions can be found by optimisation. These cases include a state-dependent patch selection problem, a simple game between predators and prey, and a more complex vertical migration scenario for a planktivorous fish. In all cases, the optimal solution is calculated and compared with the solution achieved using ING. The results show that the ING method finds optimal or close to optimal solutions for the problems presented. In addition it has a wider range of potential application areas than conventional techniques in behavioural modelling. Especially the method is well suited for complex problems where other methods fail to provide answers.},

By contrast, in many tropical regions, where butterfly faunas are more diverse than in temperate zones and the resources for practical conservation are restricted, the major emphasis is on protection of habitats to safeguard relatively poorly documented assemblages, and on conservation measures that benefit local people. Aspects of butterfly ecology are discussed in relation to sound management of species and faunas, and selected examples from Europe, North America, and elsewhere exemplify increasing global interest in butterfly conservation.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the manner in which ecological communities respond during a time of decreasing precipitation is a first step in understanding how they will respond to longer-term climate change. Here we coupled analysis of interannual variability in remotely sensed data with analyses of bird and butterfly community changes in montane meadow communities of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Landsat satellite imagery was used to classify these meadows into six types along a hydrological gradient. The northern portion of the ecosystem, or Gallatin region, has smaller mean patch sizes separated by ridges of mountains, whereas the southern portion of the ecosystem, or Teton region, has much larger patches within the Jackson Hole valley. Both support a similar suite of butterfly and bird species. The Gallatin region showed more overall among-year variation in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) when meadow types were pooled within regions, perhaps because the patch sizes are smaller on average. Bird and butterfly communities showed significant relationships relative to meadow type and NDVI. We identified several key species that are tightly associated with specific meadow types along the hydrological gradient. Comparing taxonomic groups, fewer birds showed specific habitat affinities than butterflies, perhaps because birds are responding to differences in habitat structure among meadow types and using the landscape at a coarser scale than the butterflies. Comparing regions, the Teton region showed higher predictability of community assemblages as compared to the Gallatin region. The Gallatin region exhibited more significant temporal trends with respect to butterflies. Butterfly communities in wet meadows showed a distinctive shift along the hydrological gradient during a drought period (1997-2000). These results imply that the larger Teton meadows will show more predictable (i.e., static) species-habitat associations over the long term, but that the smaller Gallatin meadows may be an area that will exhibit the effects of global climate change faster.},

Models are spatially explicit when they combine a population simulator with a landscape map that describes the spatial distribution of landscape features. With this map, the locations of habitat patches, individuals, and other items of interest are explicitly incorporated into the model, and the effect of changing landscape features on population dynamics can be studied. In this paper we describe the structure of some spatially explicit models under development and provide examples of current and future research using these models. Spatially explicit models are important tools for investigating scale-related questions in population ecology, especially the response of organisms to habitat change occurring at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Simulation models that incorporate real-world landscapes, as portrayed by landscape maps created with geographic information systems, are also proving to be crucial in the development of management strategies in response to regional land-use and other global change processes. Spatially explicit population models will increase our ability to accurately model complex landscapes, and therefore should improve both basic ecological knowledge of landscape phenomena and applications of landscape ecology to conservation and management.},

Several recent studies point out an intriguing and distinctive looping behavior by butterflies at habitat patch edges and hypothesize that this behavior requires a new framework for analyzing animal movement. We show that this looping behavior could be caused by a longstanding movement model, biased correlated random walk, with bias toward habitat patches. The ability of this longstanding model to explain recent observations reinforces the point that butterflies respond to habitat heterogeneity and do not move randomly through heterogeneous environments. We discuss the implications of different movement models for predicting butterfly responses to landscape change, and our rationale for retaining longstanding movement models, rather than developing new modeling frameworks for looping behavior at patch edges.},

	abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) and metapopulation theory are valuable tools to model the dynamics of spatially structured populations. In this article we used a spatially realistic population dynamic model to simulate the trajectory of a Proclossiana eunomia metapopulation in a network of habitat patches located in the Belgian Ardenne. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the relative influence of the different parameters on the model output. We simulated habitat loss by removing a percentage of the original habitat, proportionally in each habitat patch. Additionally, we evaluated isolation and fragmentation effects by removing and dividing habitat patches from the network, respectively. The model predicted a slow decline of the metapopulation size and occupancy. Extinction risks predicted by the model were highly sensitive to environmental stochasticity and carrying capacity. For a determined level of habitat destruction, the expected lifetime of the metapopulation was highly dependent on the spatial configuration of the landscape. Moreover, when the proportion of removed habitat is above 40\% of the original habitat, the loss of whole patches invariably leads to the strongest reduction in metapopulation viability.

Narrow sea straits, therefore, often represent areas where species are able to disperse from one land mass to another. In the Mediterranean Sea, the narrowest connecting points between North Africa and Europe are the Strait of Gibraltar and the Strait of Sicily. In the past, climatic oscillations caused changing sea levels and thus influenced the permeability of these sea straits. We analysed the genetic structure of four butterfly species that all occur on both sides of the Strait of Sicily. In all four species, we observed a lack of genetic differentiation between the populations of North Africa and those of Italy. Species distribution models support the strong cohesiveness in that they show a largely continuous glacial distribution over Italy and North Africa. The data obtained reveal that there was a large exchange of individuals between Italy and the eastern Maghreb during the last ice age. This might not only be the case for the species under investigation in the present study, but also might represent a more general pattern for mobile thermophilic western Palearctic species},

The butterflies were immobilized and their wings were folded together dorsally, so that only mimicry in the characters of the underside of the wings was being tested. 2) The procedure in these experiments differed from that described for the two earlier series in that the former experimental birds now were given mimics only, whereas the former control birds for the first time were given initial trials with models, followed by trials with mimics. This reversal in the respective roles of the two sets of birds was made in order to test mimicry with the former control group. 3) Although the model was unpalatable to the experimental birds (C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4), these birds failed to remember not to touch the models. 4) This failure may be a result of the fact that in the two earlier experiments these birds (C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4) had experience only with relatively palatable butterflies. 5) Three of the control birds (E-1, E-2, and E-3) refused the mimic on sight alone. 6) This rejection of the mimic may be a result of the earlier experience of these birds (E-1, E-2, and E-3) with Danaus plexippus, model, and Limenitis archippus archipus, mimic. Presumably the birds mistook the present mimic, L. a. floridensis, for the former model and mimic (see plate). 7) A new bird (E-4A), which had had no previous laboratory experience with D. plexippus or L. a. archippus, showed that the mimic, L. a. floridensis, is palatable, by eating it consistently. 8) The experiments with the experimental birds (C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4) suggest that experience with an over-all preponderance of unpalatable models is necessary for mimicry to operate effectively. 9) The behavior of the control birds (E-1, E-2, and E-3) suggests that, on the basis of past experience with the color pattern and associated unpalatability of a model, generalization can take place by which birds incorporate another, similar color pattern from a slightly different mimetic complex into the group of butterflies which they recognize as unpalatable. 10) This tendency of the birds to refuse a generally similar color pattern on sight alone suggests that even a moderate resemblance of an incipient mimic to a model might have selective value and further suggests therefore that mimicry could arise by increasing resemblance of mimic to model.},

Climate change may exacerbate species invasions across communities if non-native species are better able to respond to climate changes than native species. Recent evidence indicates that species that respond to climate change by adjusting their phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering) have historically increased in abundance. The extent to which non-native species success is similarly linked to a favorable climate change response, however, remains untested. We analyzed a dataset initiated by the conservationist Henry David Thoreau that documents the long-term phenological response of native and non-native plant species over the last 150 years from Concord, Massachusetts (USA). Our results demonstrate that non-native species, and invasive species in particular, have been far better able to respond to recent climate change by adjusting their flowering time. This demonstrates that climate change has likely played, and may continue to play, an important role in facilitating non-native species naturalization and invasion at the community level.},

Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.},

	abstract = {1.Flight is a key innovation in the evolution of insects that is crucial to their dispersal, migration, territoriality, courtship and predator avoidance. Male butterflies have characteristic territoriality and courtship flight behaviours, and females use a characteristic flight behaviour when searching for host plants. This implies that selection acts on wing morphology to maximize flight performance for conducting important behaviours among sexes. 2.Butterflies in the genus Morpho are obvious components of neotropical forests, and many observations indicate that they show two broad categories of flight behaviour and flight height. Although species can be categorized as using gliding or flapping flight, and flying at either canopy or understorey height, the association of flight behaviour and flight height with wing shape evolution has never been explored. 3.Two clades within Morpho differ in flight behaviour and height. Males and females of one clade inhabit the forest understorey and use flapping flight, whereas in the other clade, males use gliding flight at canopy level and females use flapping flight in both canopy and understorey. 4.We used independent contrasts to answer whether wing shape is associated with flight behaviour and height. Given a single switch to canopy habitation and gliding flight, we compared contrasts for the node at which the switch to canopy flight occurred with the distribution of values in the two focal clades. We found significant changes in wing shape at the transition to canopy flight only in males, and no change in size for either sex. A second node within the canopy clade suggests that other factors may also be involved in wing shape evolution. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that natural selection acts differently on male and female butterfly wing shape and indicate that the transition to canopy flight cannot explain all wing shape diversity in Morpho. 5.This study provides a starting point for characterizing evolution of wing morphology in forest butterflies in the contexts of habitat selection and flight behaviour. Further, these observations suggest that exploring wing shape evolution for canopy and understorey species in other insects may help understand the effects of habitat destruction on biological diversity.},

The insects represent around 75\% of the world's fauna and as such provide especially good examples of the evolutionary process in action, aided by their often rapid generation time and high rate of reproduction. 2. Here, I review some of the main mechanisms of mutational, ecological, and evolutionary change in insects. All those described, whether allo- para- or sympatric, involve changes in the genome or in behaviour that may ultimately isolate newly changed individuals from the parental population/s. They include: loss of sexuality by various means, including (potentially) mutation of the gene/s controlling sexuality; karyotypic changes, both in terms of the number of chromosomes, translocation, polyploidy, and hybridisation; host shifts as pre- and post-zygotic isolating mechanisms, and in asexuals such as aphids, 'divergence hitchhiking' around key quantitative trait loci (QTL), and in moths, selection acting at a few linkage groups; enzyme-based adaptive changes; sex and contact pheromone-based isolating mechanisms; phenotypic plastic changes; and epigenetic changes. These last such changes are brought about by stress inducers, and may be transgenerational in their effects. 3. Of the above mechanisms, probably chromosomal changes and host shifts represent the commonest mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Peatland rehabilitation projects may involve large increases in water levels if Sphagnum-based vegetation is to be restored over areas where vegetation has largely been destroyed by commercial peat-cutting processes. While this can result in the creation of cotton-sedge tussocks Eriophorum vaginatum on which large heath butterfly Coenonympha tullia larvae live, the water level changes can also lead to these tussocks being subjected to long periods of winter flooding. 2. Field trials were carried out over two winters (1996-97 and 1997-98) (1) to test laboratory predictions of the survival of C. tullia larvae under wet and dry conditions, (2) to record the behavioural responses of larvae to flooding, and (3) to determine whether vertebrate predation affected larval survival significantly. 3. Field trials confirmed the results from earlier laboratory work in that they showed that the submergence of overwintering C. tullia larvae has a marked impact on their survival. During the 1996-97 winter, 35\% of the larvae placed in wet areas survived compared with 63\% placed in dry areas. During the 1997-98 winter, none of the C. tullia larvae placed in wet areas survived compared with 54\% of the larvae placed in dry areas. Because the depth of flooding in the wet areas was much greater in the 1997-98 winter than in the 1996-97 winter, the results from this study may reflect the survival rates of wild C. tullia larvae under moderate (1996-97 data) or severe (1997-98 data) levels of flooding. 4. The behavioural data from the field also support earlier laboratory findings and suggest that C. tullia can move in order to stay above the water surface. No evidence was found that vertebrate predation was a significant factor affecting larval survival. 5. These results suggest that raised water levels threaten C. tullia populations, but that the maintenance of suitable E. vaginatum tussocks in drier areas may ensure...},

	abstract = {Maritime ringlet butterflies (Coenonympha tullia nipisiquit McDunnough) are rare, endangered salt marsh butterflies with larvae that survive periodic tidal submergence. Only six disjunct populations are known to exist. First-instar larvae were released and monitored in seven microhabitats within a salt marsh in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada. From resighting data, microhabitat-specific daily death rates were estimated with maximum likelihood. The survival of the larvae released in groups was compared by calculating minimum number of larvae known to be alive (MNKA). Death rates were low in microhabitats with the larval host plant, salt meadow cordgrass (Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl.) and the major nectar source, sea lavender (Limonium carolinianum (Walter) Britton), a habitat with a moderate frequency of flooding. Because microhabitats have a large effect on the survival rate of young larvae, use of microhabitat profiles in salt marshes as habitat-quality indices is recommended in critical-habitat assessment and reintroduction efforts.},

	abstract = {Summary 1.Climate extremes, such as severe drought, heat waves and periods of heavy rainfall, can have profound consequences for ecological systems and for human welfare. Global climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to understand their ecological consequences. 2.Major challenges for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to facilitate the statistical determination of when climate conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined as an extreme climatic event (ECE). 3.The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate extremes research, including an examination of the palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA. 4.Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently than their potential drivers and even less frequently than observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic, species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities require the development of alternative research approaches to impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Aim?Mechanistic models of old-field plant succession have generally lacked a broader biogeographic context in which climate, soils and species pools could play a significant role in mediating succession rates. We examine broad-scale patterns in old-field succession and introduce a hierarchical conceptual model to incorporate potential mechanisms operating at multiple spatial scales.Location? We reviewed secondary succession studies across the Eastern Deciduous Forest (EDF) of North America.Methods? We collected data from all published studies that reported the time necessary for woody species to reach either 10\% or 50\% cover in old-field systems throughout the EDF. We used regression approaches to determine whether rates of succession are controlled by climatic and edaphic factors that vary at broad spatial scales.Results? We found that the rate at which woody species colonize and dominate old fields decreases significantly with latitude. Rates of woody succession were highly correlated with both annual temperature (growing degree-days for years to 10\% and 50\% cover) and measures of soil fertility (cation exchange capacity and reported pre-agroindustrial (1930) maize yields for years to 10\% cover), all of which show a significant latitudinal trend across the EDF.Main conclusions? We suggest that the driver of this pattern is geographic variation in the intensity of competition between herbaceous and woody species, which we relate to the effects of (1) temperature regime, (2) edaphic factors related to soil fertility, and (3) plant traits, which may vary latitudinally in response to climate and edaphic factors. Although insufficient data exist to evaluate the relative importance of these factors, we argue that research in this area is necessary to gain an understanding of how future landscapes will be affected by global climate and land use change.},

	abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the [`]truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

	abstract = {The effects of climate change and habitat destruction and their interaction are likely to be the greatest challenge to animal and plant conservation in the twenty-first century. We used the world's smallest butterfly, the Sinai baton blue (Pseudophilotes sinaicus), as an exemplar of how global warming and human population pressures may act together to cause species extinctions. We mapped the entire global range of this butterfly and obtained extensive data on the intensity of livestock grazing. As with an increasing number of species, it is confined to a network of small habitat patches and is threatened both by indirect human-induced factors (global warming) and by the direct activities of humans (in this case, livestock grazing and collection of medicinal plants). In the absence of global warming, grazing, and plant collection, our model suggested that the butterfly will persist for at least 200 years. Above a threshold intensity of global warming, the chance of extinction accelerated rapidly, implying that there may be an annual average temperature, specific to each endangered species, above which extinction becomes very much more likely. By contrast, there was no such threshold of grazing pressure2014the chance of extinction increased steadily with increasing grazing. The impact of grazing, however, decreased with higher levels of year-to-year variation in habitat quality. The effect of global warming did not depend on the future level of grazing, suggesting that the impacts of global warming and grazing are additive. If the areas of habitat patches individually fall below certain prescribed levels, the butterfly is likely to go extinct. Two patches were very important for persistence: if either were lost the species would probably go extinct. Our results have implications for the conservation management of all species whose habitats are at risk because of the direct activities of humans and in the longer term because of climate change. Probablemente, los efectos del cambio climï¿½tico y de la destrucciï¿½n del hï¿½bitat y su interacciï¿½n son el mayor reto para la conservaciï¿½n de animales y plantas en el siglo veintiuno. Utilizamos a la mariposa mï¿½s pequeï¿½a del mundo, Pseudophilotes sinaicus, como ejemplo de cï¿½mo pueden actuar conjuntamente el calentamiento global y las presiones de la poblaciï¿½n humana para causar la extinciï¿½n de especies. Elaboramos un mapa de la distribuciï¿½n global de esta mariposa y obtuvimos datos copiosos sobre la intensidad del apacentamiento de ganado. Como sucede con muchas especies, estï¿½ confinada a una red de pequeï¿½os parches de hï¿½bitat y esta amenazada tanto por factores inducidos indirectamente por humanos (calentamiento global) como por actividades humanas directas (en este caso, apacentamiento de ganado y recolecciï¿½n de plantas medicinales). En ausencia de calentamiento global, apacentamiento y recolecta de plantas, nuestro modelo sugiriï¿½ que la mariposa persistirï¿½ por lo menos 200 aï¿½os. Por encima de una intensidad umbral de calentamiento global, la probabilidad de extinciï¿½n se acelerï¿½ rï¿½pidamente, lo que implica que puede haber una temperatura media anual, especï¿½fica para cada especie amenazada, sobre la cual la extinciï¿½n es mï¿½s probable. En contraste, no hubo tal umbral de presiï¿½n de apacentamiento2014 la probabilidad de extinciï¿½n aumenta constantemente con el incremento de apacentamiento. Sin embargo, el impacto de apacentamiento decreciï¿½ con niveles mayores de variaciï¿½n anual en la calidad del hï¿½bitat. El efecto del calentamiento global no dependiï¿½ del nivel de apacentamiento en el futuro, lo que sugiere que los impactos del calentamiento global y del apacentamiento son aditivos. Si las ï¿½reas de parches de hï¿½bitat caen individualmente bajo ciertos niveles prescritos, es probable que la mariposa se extinga. Dos parches fueron muy importantes para la persistencia: si ambos desaparecieran la especie probablemente se extinguirï¿½a. Nuestros resultados tienen implicaciones para la conservaciï¿½n de todas las especies cuyo hï ½bitat esta en riesgo debido a las actividades directas de humanos y, en el largo plazo, debido al cambio climï¿½tico.},

These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

Policy-makers and resource managers must now prepare for the impacts from climate change and support implementing such plans on the ground. In this paper we argue that climate change challenges the region to maintain its economic viability, but also holds some opportunities that may enhance economic development, human well-being, and social justice. To face these challenges and seize these opportunities effectively we must better understand adaptation capacities, opportunities and constraints, the social processes of adaptation, approaches for engaging critical players and the broader public in informed debate, decision-making, and conscious interventions in the adaptation process. This paper offers a preliminary qualitative assessment, in which we emphasize the need for (1) assessing the feasibility and side effects of technological adaptation options, (2) increasing available resources and improving equitable access to them, (3) increasing institutional flexibility, fit, cooperation and decision-making authority, (4) using and enhancing human and social capital, (5) improving access to insurance and other risk-spreading mechanisms, and (6) linking scientific information more effectively to decision-makers while engaging the public. Throughout, we explore these issues through illustrative sectoral examples. We conclude with a number of principles that may guide the preparation of future adaptation plans for the Northeast.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of some climatic extremes. These may have drastic impacts on biodiversity, particularly if meteorological thresholds are crossed, leading to population collapses. Should this occur repeatedly, populations may be unable to recover, resulting in local extinctions. Comprehensive time series data on butterflies in Great Britain provide a rare opportunity to quantify population responses to both past severe drought and the interaction with habitat area and fragmentation. Here, we combine this knowledge with future projections from multiple climate models, for different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and for simultaneous modelled responses to different landscape characteristics. Under RCP8.5, which is associated with ‘business as usual’ emissions, widespread drought-sensitive butterfly population extinctions could occur as early as 2050. However, by managing landscapes and particularly reducing habitat fragmentation, the probability of persistence until mid-century improves from around zero to between 6 and 42\% (95\% confidence interval). Achieving persistence with a greater than 50\% chance and right through to 2100 is possible only under both low climate change (RCP2.6) and semi-natural habitat restoration. Our data show that, for these drought-sensitive butterflies, persistence is achieved more effectively by restoring semi-natural landscapes to reduce fragmentation, rather than simply focusing on increasing habitat area, but this will only be successful in combination with substantial emission reductions.},

Many discussions of simulation, and indeed the term "numerical experiments," invoke a strong metaphor of experimentation. On the other hand, many simulations begin as attempts to apply scientific theories. This has lead many to characterize simulation as lying between theory and experiment. The aim of the paper is to try to reconcile these two points of view: to understand what methodological and epistemological features simulation has in common with experimentation, while at the same time keeping a keen eye on simulation’s ancestry as a form of scientific theorizing. In so doing, it seeks to apply some of the insights of recent work on the philosophy of experiment to an aspect of theorizing that is of growing philosophical interest: the construction of local models.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term fragmentation should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) Abstract Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

Relatively little is known about the response of plants and animals at lower latitudes. Here we show that the average first spring flight of 23 butterfly species in the Central Valley of California has advanced to an earlier date over the past 31 years. Among the species that have appeared significantly earlier, the average shift is 24 days. Climatic conditions (largely winter temperature and precipitation) are found to explain a large part of the variation in changing date of first flight. These results suggest a strong ecological influence of changing climatic conditions on a suite of animals from a mid-latitude, Mediterranean climate.},

We identify a remedy for the inflated type-I error of three-way Mantel tests using phylogenetic permutations; however, this test still has considerably lower power than independent contrasts.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit; when IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020.
British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton first coined the term in 1999 while working at Auto-ID Labs (originally called Auto-ID centers, referring to a global network of objects connected to radio-frequency identification, or RFID). Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications. The interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects), is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields, while also enabling advanced applications like a smart grid, and expanding to the areas such as smart cities.
"Things," in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals, electric clams in coastal waters, automobiles with built-in sensors, DNA analysis devices for environmental/food/pathogen monitoring or field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations. Legal scholars suggest to look at "Things" as an "inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service". These devices collect useful data with the help of various existing technologies and then autonomously flow the data between other devices. Current market examples include smart thermostat systems and washer/dryers that use Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.
As well as the expansion of Internet-connected automation into a plethora of new application areas, IoT is also expected to generate large amounts of data from diverse locations, with the consequent necessity for quick aggregation of the data, and an increase in the need to index, store, and process such data more effectively. IoT is one of the platforms of today's Smart City, and Smart Energy Management Systems.},

Using a functional community metric that describes abundance, life history traits and conservation status, based upon Grime's CSR (Competitive-Stress tolerant-Ruderal) scheme, we investigated how British butterfly communities changed during an extreme drought in 1995. Throughout Britain, the total abundance of these insects had a significant tendency to increase, accompanied by substantial changes in community composition, particularly in more northerly, wetter sites. Communities tended to shift away from specialist, vulnerable species, and towards generalist, widespread species and, in the year following, communities had yet to return to equilibrium. Importantly, heterogeneity in surrounding landscapes mediated community responses to the drought event. Contrary to expectation, however, community shifts were more extreme in areas of greater topographic diversity, whilst land-cover diversity buffered community changes and limited declines in vulnerable specialist butterflies.

	abstract = {Nutrition is a key component of life-history theory, yet we know little about how diet quality shapes life-history evolution across species. Here, we test whether quantitative measures of nutrition are linked to life-history evolution across 96 species of butterflies representing over 50 independent diet shifts. We find that butterflies feeding on high nitrogen host plants as larvae are more fecund, but their eggs are smaller relative to their body size. Nitrogen and sodium content of host plants are also both positively related to eye size. Some of these relationships show pronounced lineage-specific effects. Testis size is not related to nutrition. Additionally, the evolutionary timing of diet shifts is not important, suggesting that nutrition affects life histories regardless of the length of time a species has been adapting to its diet. Our results suggest that, at least for some lineages, species with higher nutrient diets can invest in a range of fitness-related traits like fecundity and eye size while allocating less to each egg as offspring have access to a richer diet. These results have important implications for the evolution of life histories in the face of anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability.},
