## This site

. . . is written, built, and maintained in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) using the [R](https://www.r-project.org) [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website generator. See [Making a Website Using Blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site). 

Everything is open-source, plain-text, future-proof, platform-independent, all-natural, and various other things of this nature.

The [emoticon](http://mashable.com/2014/05/23/fun-text-emoticons/#N4_ti1BAhuqw) at the top of the sidebar is [Cthulhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu), from [H. P. Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft)'s short story [The Call of Cthulhu](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx).
